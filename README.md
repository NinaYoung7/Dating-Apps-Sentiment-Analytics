The research means to help the dating appcompanies to understand the users’ demand and favor to improve the satisfaction by developingthe apps.The research aims to analyze comments and ratings of dating apps and investigate whatfeatures of the dating apps users care the most about. Which word in the comments has the mostpositive influence on rating? Which word in the comments has the most negative impact onrating?


## Summary
We  extracted customer reviews of apps in the Apple Store for the last three months by iTunes API. Performed Sentiment Analysis  with “bing” dictionary from customer reviews and created Word Cloud to show how often it’s mentioned and the more important it is. Also, we used Feature Extraction(Bag of Words and TF-IDF)to count the frequency of words in reviews and determine how relevant those words are to their reviews. In addition, Topic Modeling(LDA) is created to discover themes about what customers care about from reviews. Then LSA technique compresses the useful information into lower dimensions at the expense of some information loss noise.

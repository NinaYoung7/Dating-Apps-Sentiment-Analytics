8413412738,3/2/22 18:47,man in the res,13.1.0,Too much scammers/ fake accounts with the repeat I‚Äôve same names,2,"After creating an account on Tinder, I was excited to meet and enter at with new people on tinder at first. However, after several matches with different ‚Äúgirls‚Äù, I‚Äôve noticed that some girls names show the same name over and over again. (from Allison to Maddison and etc). Moreover, I feel that Tinder doesn‚Äôt care if scammers use this app to lure different people to talk to them, which could lead to potential dangers of our lives. Although this app was good at first, but it strategically fell down hill. So, if Tinder is listening, upgrade your security measures to ensure the safety of other people‚Äôs identity and identify the scammers.",Tinder

8413352687,3/2/22 18:20,Catastrobri,13.1.0,Glitchy App,1,"UPDATE - Nevermind. I am completely baffled by Tinder. I emailed and reported the technological errors I was encountering and 12 hours later they emailed me back notifying that my account was suddenly banned for ‚Äúviolating community guidelines‚Äù. I reviewed every single guideline and I had never once violated a single one. I have never once sent an inappropriate, offensive, or derogatory message. I have never once misrepresented myself. But I am suddenly banned after reporting technological errors. 

Men can get on this app and message you the most obscene and offense things and manage to keep their accounts and continue to terrorize women. But god forbid you report technological errors? 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-
Some of the reviews here are a bit confusing. It‚Äôs a bit strange to give an app a bad review for your poor dating results. 

My review stems from the sole factor of the app being SO GLITCHY! I have the worst time with this app after the past few updates.

- I‚Äôll get notifications for messages that won‚Äôt load on the screen for DAYS. Like, no new messages will show for DAYS. When I check- the sent time will be from days prior but just show up right then. 
- I‚Äôll get asked to ‚Äúverify I‚Äôm human‚Äù and it‚Äôll just glitch out and keep asking over and over and over until you uninstall and reinstall the app! 
- Sometimes pictures won‚Äôt upload.

It makes it super frustrating to use!",Tinder

The ad revenue isn‚Äôt enough for them and my friends that have been successful on the app after it became a cash grab paid for boosts (they lied about it ofc, but I caught them in their lie). I used to have pretty good luck on here back when Tinder was relatively new, but now it‚Äôs just a waste of time and after the first day of being a free member it‚Äôs clear no one sees my profile (I‚Äôll rack up likes the first day, then suddenly nothing). It‚Äôs obvious why it works this way and resetting your account doesn‚Äôt cut it anymore. Tinder also has next to zero respect for GDPR and won‚Äôt disclose all of the information they keep on you (Google it).

Although you may be the most attractive out of your social group, tinder will be there to reassure you that you are not as interesting as you may seem. It came to the point where simply swiping for a minute or two lowered my self-esteem drastically. Talk about an ego crusher.

I simple said I can‚Äôt pick her up, all because she saw me living good , and driving exotic cars after FaceTiming me several times asking my whereabouts which gave me a panic like some scheme is being plotted I woke up to see tinder saying my account was banned , I appealed and sent proof that she was even the one violating me, tinder still replies a verified account with a blue check and my pictures there that I violated and that my account is banned.

The ‚Äúalgorithm‚Äù is terrible (and I‚Äôm an attractive, educated woman).  I tried this app for a few months (both paid and free) bc I had heard it was the app to go on to find a relationship but the way the app works, I found very non conducive to maximizing matches. Notifying each time you send a ‚Äúlike‚Äù made me less likely to send one if I was on the fence. I have gone on so many actual dates on Tinder and Bumble. With Hinge, I went on zero and had much fewer matches.  The conversations I had were lackluster and sometimes w men who were hours away.  I paid for 3 months to see all the likes I received at the same time and thinking I‚Äôd want to have more than 8 likes per day but I barely could find one per day.  (It was more like one per week).

Don‚Äôt waste your money on buying extra roses.  The app makes you think you should buy them to match with the ‚Äústand outs‚Äù but those people get recycled and show up again and again. I‚Äôm not even sure they‚Äôre all real profiles.  It‚Äôs a great marketing ploy but seems a bit like a scam. There‚Äôs no way to know if the person received the rose, if you‚Äôre outside their preferences. Also, the person gets a notification that a rose was sent to them from you and that it‚Äôs extra special - so embarrassing (I only know this bc someone sent me one).  It won‚Äôt help you w getting more dates, believe me.

Maybe it was catfishing, but I liked the photo and told the person it was a really great shot and they should put it up higher. The women responded with a tirade about how men don‚Äôt get to decide what‚Äôs a good photo or not, What the F**k, go to H**l, etc. I responded tongue and cheek and thought it was over. A day later I was banned. No warning, no temporary suspension, banned for life! It didn‚Äôt matter than 15 other women had matched with me.

One woman that I had been texting with off the app, contacted me and asked why I unmatched with her. Hinge does some things right, but like many other hi-tech behemoths they think they own you, and they basically do.

The discover page has always been a mixed bag, some people aren't your type and some are, that's life. However, between standouts Ave the recent update, that no longer seems to be the case. The discover feed is filled with brand new accounts (which is fine, they've been the closest to the type of people I tend to match with) or accounts that are significantly different from any person I've ever matched with on the app. From incomplete profiles, to basic answer incompatibilities and an algorithm that clearly knows your preferences but ignores them behind a paywall. I purchased the premium model and I'm currently using it, I don't recommend. My best matches are in preferred, which is nice but I never see any of them in the feed and even with a premium account, you only get one way to match with you ""preferred match"" for free for a week. So, you'll see about 70 profiles that you really like in a week and you're only able to reach out to one, even with premium. It seems to me that the hinge algorithm has gotten better, as the preferred page has really good matches. However, that algorithm seems to go out the window for discover. For anyone who likes/liked this app, I'd recommend getting the free version. You'll save money and annoyance, you might even see more people that you like. It seems like I was served more people who are a good match before I paid, I'm assuming it's a way to make sure that free users see enough people that they like to think that it's worth it. It's not. You'll likely swipe through a sea of profiles are largely not what you're looking for only to be annoyed that you paid and still can't even send a basic like to your preferred matches.

I truly wish I could post pictures to show you guys the evidence I have gathered to back all this up but as you use the app you will notice it as well. I find it odd that hinge has 2 categories of defining people‚Ä¶. There is the regular H  category at the bottom left where majority of people swipe on people and such and it‚Äôs the main interaction place (in theory). Then they have the ‚ÄúStar‚Äù category which is hinges EXCLUSIVE members that are supposed to be better matches for you! (In theory). But as you use the app, notice you probably swipe around 70/90 times in the H category before even swiping right once, and in the star category it‚Äôs ALWAYS the woman or men that you truly find attractive in all areas‚Ä¶ the app after the first 30 people you like and try to match with understands ‚Äúyour type‚Äù or the type of people you find attractive and kind and who‚Äôs personality is what you‚Äôre looking for. That‚Äôs the point of the app to find the GOOD matches for you. But what they don‚Äôt tell you or want to admit is. Once they find out you‚Äôre type and such they actually  throw the complete opposites types of people at you untill you have spent enough time and money on the app then the app rewards you with ‚ÄúCOMPATIBLE matches‚Äù what I‚Äôm trying to explain here is that Hinge is deliberately sending you the opposite types of people to you because they need more users spending time in the app then actully matching. Their target audience are desperate people who have had 0 luck still in their dating lives and have moved on from other apps like tinder And  okcupid and such etc‚Ä¶  Hinge knows exactly what they are doing and it‚Äôs wasting our times and taking our money because there are enough desperate people to off set things. It actually makes me very sad to see how many opportunities we miss because we don‚Äôt pay them 20$. Multiple people, friends, family etc‚Ä¶ can also confirm that 90% of hinges H matches for you are the opposite attractiveness, opposite personality type etc etc‚Ä¶. It shocks me how such an app can be so successful due to people in such desperation that they are will to go throw 70/90 people before swiping right on even one compared to paying 20$ for the ‚Äústar‚Äù category.

Not as many likes as other apps so if you match with someone, they have chosen you more carefully than other apps that allow you to like every single person you pass through. You can put distance settings for free and reverse a pass. If you run out of people it gives you an option to see the people you passed again or you can put the distance setting further. The bulk of the things you need to find matches and talk with people is free. Again, only thing that appears like a downside is there are less likes but I do think it actually helps people choose more carefully what they are looking for, and take the choices more seriously.

The only issue is Hinge has a much smaller user base. It is a more tight knit and less superficial community, which I appreciate, but it is easier to run out of people. New people do join fairly often so it‚Äôs nice to see some new faces every week.

Everyone I know who uses Hinge hates the rose feature and finds it cringy, so of course I‚Äôm never going to send one. It basically dooms a relationship, even if we might be compatible. So I don‚Äôt send them, because I know the people I match with will find it gross. See the problem? The people I‚Äôm actually interested in are completely unattainable, locked inside the standouts section. So instead, I sift through loads of likes from men I have no interest in whatsoever.

I downloaded the app in December 2021 and quickly had several matches of quality people who fit what I was looking for, but one of the first people I met ended up being amazing and we quickly developed a strong relationship. They were one of the ‚Äúrecommended to me‚Äù persons and we hit it off immediately. 

Just a few ideas on my end for Hinge, now that I‚Äôm done with the app and it‚Äôs been deleted:

1- give a request for a deletion reason. Right now, when you delete the app, it‚Äôs just deleted, but I feel like it should be asking why you‚Äôre deleting so they can track the success of the app. Add me to the ‚Äúdon‚Äôt need it anymore‚Äù category. 

2- push users to take conversations offline. Right now, Hinge detects when a phone number is shared in chat and follows up asking if you met, but that‚Äôs it. I found a few conversations lingered in that ‚Äúrelationship Q&A‚Äù phase but Hinge should push users to migrate off the app and move. Maybe after 5-10 messages send a prompt to each user to say ‚Äúenjoying the conversation? Maybe you should meet!‚Äù to take away some anxiety some users may have in moving forward. 

3- entice users to send messages with their likes. This isn‚Äôt Tinder; I had 10+ likes only with no comments. Those matches never pushed forward because the users weren‚Äôt trying to engage me, so I didn‚Äôt want to engage them. Bumble sends a ‚Äúare your sure‚Äù message when you try to send just a simple ‚Äúhey‚Äù, Hinge should prevent likes only. 

Great app, thanks to the developers for this as it‚Äôs been an awesome experience that I hope to never have to repeat!",Hinge

Pros: Women message first. Lots of quick stats you can look at if people fill them out. Good and easy UI. Lots of users in many areas due to popularity.

Cons: The app doesn‚Äôt force you to completely fill out the profile which leaves you looking at a lot of empty profiles. You can no longer use two free filters. Their customer support is non existent. If you don‚Äôt use your account for awhile they seem to autodelete it but not really because you have to use a new email. The app uses a ton of data so it appears there are several networking issues. The app crashes consistently and logs you out. Even when I have good service, I have trouble sending and receiving messages. There are a ton of couples/polys on the app especially in my area and there needs to be a separate gender filter for that. And last but not least (actually it‚Äôs the reason I updated this review): I‚Äôve been banned from the app and they won‚Äôt tell me why and there‚Äôs no way to get unbanned from what I can tell.

Remember: these apps don‚Äôt want you to find anyone; any users who find lasting relationships don‚Äôt keep using the app, and users who stop using the app don‚Äôt pay for subscriptions.

It really only caters to heterosexual people, and even then it‚Äôs an ableist feature that does not consider those with anxiety or other difficult mental disorders. I feel like they added that feature to ‚Äúput women in control‚Äù but it‚Äôs false empowerment completely. We‚Äôre obviously interested in each other if we matched, so why take away 50% of the chance to talk to each other just because one is a woman and one is a man?",Bumble

One suggestion I have is that when you‚Äôre first looking at the profile of someone and you scroll to the bottom you only have the option to swipe right or super swipe them but you can‚Äôt send them a message right then and there and that would be an improvement I think to have that option because the other person can still not respond if they don‚Äôt feel like you have enough in common and that‚Äôs it that‚Äôs all I have for you so far  - thanks..!",Bumble

8381347209,2/21/22 16:48,mivkarlk88,5.250.0,These apps are toxic money pits with no soul.,1,"These apps are fundamentally toxic and are most likely rigged. Most people look at a picture and take 3-5 seconds to tell if someone is worth even initiating a conversation with. Both sides have to agree that the other looks to their standards. You are making an app that you use a picture to determine if someone LOOKS good. Both sides have to agree on looks of the other. If either side says no for any reason, they can no longer talk and it‚Äôs a wasted connection. This is just the fundamental principle of this concept and is a reflection of a society and culture that only judges who they want to entertain based on LOOKS and nothing else. Any relationship that does get to happen will not be guaranteed to actually work as there‚Äôs more than someone than LOOKS. Society has made it so these and other apps are becoming the only means of social activity. No longer can you go out and physically see people and get to know them but that‚Äôs a whole other topic for other soapbox.

Now on to how the apps actually behave. You have to understand when someone swipes right on someone it doesn‚Äôt need to tell the other party that they said yes to you. The app and the backend could just ignore it and tell you that you have no results. The app can also limit who sees your profile and what profiles you get to see. The app can hide your profile even if you are using their paid priority show me first mechanic. This here adds to a system that already puts the odds in the favor of the house. If I‚Äôm spending actual real life money on this app, I should be shown first to everyone when they open the app similar to lightning lane or fastpass. For the amount of money paid for premium subscription, they shouldn‚Äôt be gatekeeping potential friends or otherwise and my profile should be shown to everyone and when me or someone swipes right, it should go through to the other person 100% of the time. A possible solution to that would be to show ‚Äúpeople who you didn‚Äôt like who liked you‚Äù below people you didn‚Äôt already make a decision on. You can still make money and not be rigged like a slot machine. I would like more transparency in the app and would like to see more metrics like how many people liked or disliked me. Another thing you can do is add ‚Äúwhy do you like/dislike this person‚Äù with 5 options so the other person can give constructive feedback or praise that they need to answer before going to the next person in line. The app and similar apps with similar to identical business models are toxic and are extremely harmful to a society of people with already low self confidence, anxiety and even sadly depression and social anxiety. If people are not liked on your apps, they might translate that to other social media and the real world and think they are worthless all because you want to make a buck and count beans. I know running an app and hiring people is not free but, like I said before you can still make money and let people actually connect to others. It shouldn‚Äôt be rocket science to find a friend or otherwise on your apps especially when you pay a premium to use them.",Bumble

I kid you not I get 1 match per month on this app and their response was my pictures are blurry. 
I really only date other girls of my culture just to make my parents happy but ya out of all the apps bumble had the weakest results and it‚Äôs bad cause I bought premium‚Ä¶

On Hinge I get 1-2 likes per day without premium and as a guy I guess that‚Äôs a lot versus the standard 100 per minute a girl gets.

Bumble said: use ‚Äúclear photos‚Äù but my accurate guess is they did something to make my account show up less or they make it so your seen a lot when you first start using the app and when you make purchases. 

Try 
Hinge 
Culture specific dating apps (if you have to please your parents)
Tinder
- Bumble is at the bottom

End experience for a daily user for a month and I‚Äôve had it for about 6 months

When two people match, there should be no further permission or confirmation needed in order to start chatting. We are adults, not children. If you do not want someone to message you, then do not swipe right on them. If you swiped right by accident and don‚Äôt want to talk to them, then simply unmatch with them. 99% of the time I match with someone, they never even send that first message, so the chat expires. Can someone explain what the point of that is? I watch match after match expire and I am not even allowed to reach out and send a message to someone who, after all, showed interest in me. Since men cannot initiate conversation I think it is abusing the service for women to swipe right on men and never send them a message. Was it just the little ego boost they were after anyway? It makes for a very frustrating experience for men as their hands are tied and they have no way of reaching out. What a childish game. Most women simply say something like ‚ÄòHi‚Äô as a first message anyway, which is fine, but this essentially means that they still want you to start the conversation after all. I believe most women don‚Äôt really want to message first, and if this is true then the rule is actually going against what most women want, making it even dumber. ‚ÄòWomen message first‚Äô is a stupid and pointless extra step in the process. I cannot see how simply being the first to message after you match with someone empowers the woman in any way. That‚Äôs not real empowerment, it‚Äôs pointless virtue signaling by Bumble.",Bumble

Apparently I am a match with a couple of but it only gives them 24 hours to message back and I just have to wait. I did have the opportunity to extend the time for another 24 hours. But It ran out. For some people finding a match is difficult.

It would be nice for the profile not to be limited to 3 questions to get to know the person more before swiping. There‚Äôs really not much to go off of except for looks and generic things that many people have in common. 

If the app is serious about connecting people for a potential relationship then allow the user to have the option to put as much as they want or as little as they want. And maybe real get-to-know-me questions too.. not only irrelevant, comedic ones. 

Guys on here seem too casual with bios having ‚Äúdon‚Äôt take life too seriously‚Äù as a common theme. I‚Äôve gotten messages that make this app seem more like a place to hook up than actually meet a potential partner. 

Now I get that it‚Äôs not necessarily the app‚Äôs fault that guys on here don‚Äôt know proper manners when talking to women but again, it‚Äôs the lack of information in the profile that makes this app rely more on physical attraction rather than letting personality show.

One more thing, instead of waiting for the woman to make the move, I wouldn‚Äôt mind hearing from the guy first too. Especially if they swiped first. in a way, matching with them (or accepting their match so to speak) is just another way of saying, ‚Äúsure I‚Äôll chat with you‚Äù",Bumble

(Messages, matches, etc) 
I had befriended one on Instagram who told me my messages was not going through to them on Bumble Business.

I decided to upgrade and get the life membership. (To save money long term)
And to be able to connect with more people.

They advertise and suggest these features are truly unlimited when it‚Äôs not.

If you are on the free version they cap you on daily activity.

If you use the premium they see doing too much activity as spam. And can block you from the app  at any time without warning.

Due to all the technical issues I was having and people not getting my messages on the app.
I suggested people could reach out to me on Instagram or continue to speak here within the app.
(You can have your Instagram attached to your profile. Which would mean anyone could see your Instagram if they desired to.)
Which is why I ONLY shared a partnered app as an additional means of communication due to Bumbles technical issues.
I would of been more patient, however connections do expire if you do not message them promptly.

In all if I did it all over I would of stuck with the free version and only reach out to 5-10 people daily. And would of asked the other person their desired means of communication and not directly giving my own.

I have one major concern with Bumble: the ‚Äúreligion‚Äù filter should NOT be behind the paywall.

Please move this filter to the free part of the app. It‚Äôs the ONLY paid feature I care about, and I‚Äôm not paying for something so simple that should be free.

Other than that big issue, the rest seems fine as far as I‚Äôve seen. The biggest issue isn‚Äôt something they can fix, it‚Äôs an issue with my area and the demographic here.

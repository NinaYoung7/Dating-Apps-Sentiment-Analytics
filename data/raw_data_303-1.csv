8413437613,3/2/22 18:58,Stealth ninja118,13.1.0,My number was banned,1,The fact that tinder has no appeal system for their bans is ridiculous. My phone number is banned from tinder before I even got this number but that’s my issue apparently,Tinder
8413412738,3/2/22 18:47,man in the res,13.1.0,Too much scammers/ fake accounts with the repeat I’ve same names,2,"After creating an account on Tinder, I was excited to meet and enter at with new people on tinder at first. However, after several matches with different “girls”, I’ve noticed that some girls names show the same name over and over again. (from Allison to Maddison and etc). Moreover, I feel that Tinder doesn’t care if scammers use this app to lure different people to talk to them, which could lead to potential dangers of our lives. Although this app was good at first, but it strategically fell down hill. So, if Tinder is listening, upgrade your security measures to ensure the safety of other people’s identity and identify the scammers.",Tinder
8413397426,3/2/22 18:40,hhhhhleigh,13.1.0,It’s a no from me dawg,1,"0 accountability for banning chubby, trans, and diverse people. Really good app if you want to pay and your bikini pics look straight from a model set. It’s 2022, spend less time making stupid chat rooms and work on an appeals process for those who are banned for no reason.",Tinder
8413352687,3/2/22 18:20,Catastrobri,13.1.0,Glitchy App,1,"UPDATE - Nevermind. I am completely baffled by Tinder. I emailed and reported the technological errors I was encountering and 12 hours later they emailed me back notifying that my account was suddenly banned for “violating community guidelines”. I reviewed every single guideline and I had never once violated a single one. I have never once sent an inappropriate, offensive, or derogatory message. I have never once misrepresented myself. But I am suddenly banned after reporting technological errors. 

Men can get on this app and message you the most obscene and offense things and manage to keep their accounts and continue to terrorize women. But god forbid you report technological errors? 

———————————————-
Some of the reviews here are a bit confusing. It’s a bit strange to give an app a bad review for your poor dating results. 

My review stems from the sole factor of the app being SO GLITCHY! I have the worst time with this app after the past few updates.

- I’ll get notifications for messages that won’t load on the screen for DAYS. Like, no new messages will show for DAYS. When I check- the sent time will be from days prior but just show up right then. 
- I’ll get asked to “verify I’m human” and it’ll just glitch out and keep asking over and over and over until you uninstall and reinstall the app! 
- Sometimes pictures won’t upload.

It makes it super frustrating to use!",Tinder

The ad revenue isn’t enough for them and my friends that have been successful on the app after it became a cash grab paid for boosts (they lied about it ofc, but I caught them in their lie). I used to have pretty good luck on here back when Tinder was relatively new, but now it’s just a waste of time and after the first day of being a free member it’s clear no one sees my profile (I’ll rack up likes the first day, then suddenly nothing). It’s obvious why it works this way and resetting your account doesn’t cut it anymore. Tinder also has next to zero respect for GDPR and won’t disclose all of the information they keep on you (Google it). I wouldn’t be surprised if they are doing shady things with your information (which includes their method of sabotaging the effectiveness of a profile reset).",Tinder

I got a new number and so I decided to try it again and I think they banned me YET again. I have done nothing wrong and haven’t violated any guidelines. I paid for gold so I could see who liked me and now whenever I swiped right it says error. This is bull crap seeing as I paid them AND I have a verified account. Tinder won’t speak with me about this issue and instead just took my money and banned me. Don’t waste your time.,Tinder

I can 100% say it is without warrant. It’s so weird because my account was deactivated for over 6 months since I had no need for it. The moment I try to use it again, bam. There is also no customer service or appeal process. Tinder is the only app that is used over here and meeting people in public is basically not allowed due to culture.

Nothing changed, one and maybe 2 likes per day. Bumble.., over 50, yes 5 - 0 likes per day. And not just any likes, high quality ladies 8+!

Both profiles were identical with same photos, EVERYTHING the same.

Not only Tinder, but most “dating” apps are just broken. I get the idea of bringing people together along with preferences to narrow it down, however Tinder and others try to fit all groups into one. What I mean by that is - this is a dating app right? Where you go to meet people to, ya know, date? I’d say these apps are broken down into three categories of use - relationships, hooking up, and validation. I’d say most people here are on for validation. They don’t want love, they want the love they get from 20 people swiping on them inflating their ego. The next small group is looking for just sex, and the next is actual dating.

I can’t remove the same guys I have zero in common with. Nope, every week I have to swipe X on them again. No filters exist to remove guys with kids, smokers, or keywords like hunting, and it just wastes my time. It also keeps offering me the same three guys I reported for harassment.

Tinder needs an “Unmatched” section where you can see those who have unmatched you and the conversation. Let them put in a reason for unmatching you or allow them to select “No I don’t want this person to see why I unmatched” or whatever.

False accusations by your employees because of their own leftist views.

I really appreciate the level of service which comes with the paid version, so if you want to leverage your finances and care enough to do so, this has one of the better levels of service for paid users. I’m going to ask for more features I’d love to see here: I would also really enjoy being able to filter based on career and education. I would also enjoy the ability to for users to select options for how long they want their next relationship to last. ie. “One night. A few months or years. Several years. Rest of my life. Open to what happens.” I’d also like to be able to filter based on that. I think with these additions, this platform can start becoming a competitor for people looking for serious matches as well. I also think that it will create a better user experience for people, so they don’t wasted their time with people who aren’t looking for the same thing. ———————— Previous request which was listened to and developed. Thanks y’all. 🙏🏼: I would love to see some filters based on interests.

A psycho lady who is over 39 years old and obviously is not mentally stable to be on the app, chatted me up . We had a conversation and each time I try to bring up to meet she never wants to, unfortunately she kept texting me for 2-weeks sending pictures and all that and making pressures to know my intimate life , I said I don’t tell strangers much about me without knowing them face to face. We had a meeting to meet and I said ok , a day to meet she kept love bombing and asking for me to take her on an expensive date, I told her sorry I can’t come and respectfully, luckily for me I always keep chats and proof since we are in the crazy era of dating. I simple said I can’t pick her up, all because she saw me living good , and driving exotic cars after FaceTiming me several times asking my whereabouts which gave me a panic like some scheme is being plotted I woke up to see tinder saying my account was banned , I appealed and sent proof that she was even the one violating me, tinder still replies a verified account with a blue check and my pictures there that I violated and that my account is banned. I am livid and say it is quite a horrible experience , that even in the face of evidence tinder places unfair biased judgement .. I would have let the account go … but it is to let tinder know the horrible service they provide and I don’t think I might be on the app again … keep it up to let mentally deranged females to be spoiling the app, and even with evidence keep supporting an agenda that obviously with time will make you run out of business… Like what the h+ll ? !!! Even with proof , I still have to be banned… this is an open broad-day violation… and I am disappointed … sorry not sorry I just spoke how I feel.. very disappointed. I wouldn’t say people not to use your services , but to let them know how a false accusation and even with evidence it is never going well for the victim all because a female is the one that reported.

The “algorithm” is terrible (and I’m an attractive, educated woman).  I tried this app for a few months (both paid and free) bc I had heard it was the app to go on to find a relationship but the way the app works, I found very non conducive to maximizing matches. Notifying each time you send a “like” made me less likely to send one if I was on the fence. I have gone on so many actual dates on Tinder and Bumble. With Hinge, I went on zero and had much fewer matches.  The conversations I had were lackluster and sometimes w men who were hours away.  I paid for 3 months to see all the likes I received at the same time and thinking I’d want to have more than 8 likes per day but I barely could find one per day.  (It was more like one per week).

Don’t waste your money on buying extra roses.  The app makes you think you should buy them to match with the “stand outs” but those people get recycled and show up again and again. I’m not even sure they’re all real profiles.  It’s a great marketing ploy but seems a bit like a scam. There’s no way to know if the person received the rose, if you’re outside their preferences. Also, the person gets a notification that a rose was sent to them from you and that it’s extra special - so embarrassing (I only know this bc someone sent me one).  It won’t help you w getting more dates, believe me.  

Guess there’s an app for everyone but this is not the one for me. Hope others have better luck but learn from my mistake and don’t waste your time or money on extra roses bc of the “stand outs” list that you are sent.",Hinge

However, the “Standouts” feature completely ruins the app my taking the most desirable women and putting them behind a paywall, essentially. You have to use a “rose”, which is like a super-like, instead of a normal like for this curated list of potential matches. The fact that you have to pay for additional roses beyond the one you get from time to time isn’t even what bothers me, but it is the obligation to use a rose because it comes off as desperate and cheesy and I’ve NEVER had a match from a rose or super-like. It completely sabotages your chance with a girl to send a rose, so it makes these girls completely off limits. 
I actually had a girl from my “Standouts” like me organically, so I was able to match her and we had a couple of nice dates before it didn’t work out, but that was the most exciting match with the best potential I’ve had from using this app and it never could have happened from my own initiation.

The fact that you need to engage with people by text messaging to match, instead of just swiping leads to more interesting connections. After a few weeks I had 15 matches and 5 dates set up. So far so good. Then I came across a profile with 5 lackluster photos and a 6th photo that made the person look like a model. Maybe it was catfishing, but I liked the photo and told the person it was a really great shot and they should put it up higher. The women responded with a tirade about how men don’t get to decide what’s a good photo or not, What the F**k, go to H**l, etc. I responded tongue and cheek and thought it was over. A day later I was banned. No warning, no temporary suspension, banned for life! It didn’t matter than 15 other women had matched with me. One woman flagged me, and I was gone without even an explanation. Cancel culture at its best! Hinge hides behind the claim it is protecting women but in reality it is disrespecting men. It didn’t even respect the women that had matched with me by giving them an explanation or a way to keep in touch. One woman that I had been texting with off the app, contacted me and asked why I unmatched with her. Hinge does some things right, but like many other hi-tech behemoths they think they own you, and they basically do. They can cancel you without notice or an explanation and you don’t even get access to the the data and connections you made. Before you get too invested in this app, take a look at the board of directors. A bunch or corporate suits that don’t look like they have been on a date since the 80s.

The discover page has always been a mixed bag, some people aren't your type and some are, that's life. However, between standouts Ave the recent update, that no longer seems to be the case. The discover feed is filled with brand new accounts (which is fine, they've been the closest to the type of people I tend to match with) or accounts that are significantly different from any person I've ever matched with on the app. From incomplete profiles, to basic answer incompatibilities and an algorithm that clearly knows your preferences but ignores them behind a paywall. I purchased the premium model and I'm currently using it, I don't recommend. My best matches are in preferred, which is nice but I never see any of them in the feed and even with a premium account, you only get one way to match with you ""preferred match"" for free for a week. So, you'll see about 70 profiles that you really like in a week and you're only able to reach out to one, even with premium. It seems to me that the hinge algorithm has gotten better, as the preferred page has really good matches. However, that algorithm seems to go out the window for discover. For anyone who likes/liked this app, I'd recommend getting the free version. You'll save money and annoyance, you might even see more people that you like. It seems like I was served more people who are a good match before I paid, I'm assuming it's a way to make sure that free users see enough people that they like to think that it's worth it. It's not. You'll likely swipe through a sea of profiles are largely not what you're looking for only to be annoyed that you paid and still can't even send a basic like to your preferred matches.

Recently I feel I get ok people on my feed but it seems the people more attractive to you or “more your type” you have to pay more which is a scam. This should be equal free dating, if its “designed to be deleted” like they said then why charge you for people more suited to your taste. They all see to be in my area but annoyed you have to pay for roses to try to match with people you may gravitate towards more while your feed is random people I feel no spark looking at photos of or reading their prompts.

It gets very annoying hitting X for so long until there’s finally a decent looking person. I get a good amount of matches with attractive people, I’m not sure why Hinge’s algorithm wants to push people towards me that it knows I will hit X to. I understand that any dating app will have much more unattractive people than it does attractive. Wouldn’t it be more worth while to show the unattractive profiles to each other? I am a preferred member so I wish my time was better spent than wasting 5-10 minutes hitting X or messing with my preferences. I believe this can be fixed somewhat easily.",Hinge

I truly wish I could post pictures to show you guys the evidence I have gathered to back all this up but as you use the app you will notice it as well. I find it odd that hinge has 2 categories of defining people…. There is the regular H  category at the bottom left where majority of people swipe on people and such and it’s the main interaction place (in theory). Then they have the “Star” category which is hinges EXCLUSIVE members that are supposed to be better matches for you! (In theory). But as you use the app, notice you probably swipe around 70/90 times in the H category before even swiping right once, and in the star category it’s ALWAYS the woman or men that you truly find attractive in all areas… the app after the first 30 people you like and try to match with understands “your type” or the type of people you find attractive and kind and who’s personality is what you’re looking for. That’s the point of the app to find the GOOD matches for you. But what they don’t tell you or want to admit is. Once they find out you’re type and such they actually  throw the complete opposites types of people at you untill you have spent enough time and money on the app then the app rewards you with “COMPATIBLE matches” what I’m trying to explain here is that Hinge is deliberately sending you the opposite types of people to you because they need more users spending time in the app then actully matching. Their target audience are desperate people who have had 0 luck still in their dating lives and have moved on from other apps like tinder And  okcupid and such etc…  Hinge knows exactly what they are doing and it’s wasting our times and taking our money because there are enough desperate people to off set things. It actually makes me very sad to see how many opportunities we miss because we don’t pay them 20$. Multiple people, friends, family etc… can also confirm that 90% of hinges H matches for you are the opposite attractiveness, opposite personality type etc etc…. It shocks me how such an app can be so successful due to people in such desperation that they are will to go throw 70/90 people before swiping right on even one compared to paying 20$ for the “star” category.

There’s usually a free trial offer or at least when I first used it there had been. Not as many likes as other apps so if you match with someone, they have chosen you more carefully than other apps that allow you to like every single person you pass through. You can put distance settings for free and reverse a pass. If you run out of people it gives you an option to see the people you passed again or you can put the distance setting further. The bulk of the things you need to find matches and talk with people is free. Again, only thing that appears like a downside is there are less likes but I do think it actually helps people choose more carefully what they are looking for, and take the choices more seriously.

Some examples: I can’t save liked profiles, on certain days I can’t even send a “Like” or a note, I have to send a “Rose” (which I think is stupid). 

The profiles you create are limited to answering pre-selected prompts. Again, cute, but limited. I do like the fact that you can do post voice recordings, which I think is cool. But overall the Hinge experience hasn’t been fun for me, and seems pretty shallow. 

Doesn’t help that I keep having profiles pop up from straight guys and gals (I’m a lesbian, and I set my preferences as such, but still I get all these profiles of cis het dudes!) yeah, I can move on from that, but it doesn’t give me a lot of faith in their sorting and matching algorithms.

As a minority in the dating landscape (Indian guy) it’s pretty difficult to get around on apps such as Tinder and Bumble which are a lot more superficial, and you swipe almost exclusively based on how the person looks. I’ve seen a lot more success with this app because I can express my personality before I match. The app is completely usable free, which is very appreciated when you are constantly bombarded by ads and paywalls on other apps.

The only issue is Hinge has a much smaller user base. It is a more tight knit and less superficial community, which I appreciate, but it is easier to run out of people. New people do join fairly often so it’s nice to see some new faces every week.

Now, the only place I EVER see people I’m remotely interested in is in the standouts section. The algorithm pools them there, instead of your usual feed. But here’s the thing: roses are MAJOR CRINGE. When I receive roses, it’s an automatic no. Gross. Everyone I know who uses Hinge hates the rose feature and finds it cringy, so of course I’m never going to send one. It basically dooms a relationship, even if we might be compatible. So I don’t send them, because I know the people I match with will find it gross. See the problem?

After the newest update it incessantly berates you with the “Preferred Members access” while not indicating you’re out of likes. It’s a heavy predatory monetary maneuver added by the new update. Awful design and thought by developers. Seems like all this app has is awful design ideas anymore, I mean who thought 30$ of premium access for a single month was a good let alone realistic idea for most people? 

- The free likes you were already limited which was cut further down to about 8 it feels like which is already insanely low.

For example, when scrolling through conversations, the app will think u are selecting a conversation rather than scrolling up or down and then bring u to the screen of one of your match’s profile. 

In addition, if you have someone that has given you a Rose in your “Likes you” tab, the app will not give u another like or rose until u either open a conversation with that person or unmatch them. Unless the developers say something about this, you cant tell me otherwise. If the developers actually cared about bringing people together and making the world a better place, then they would do something about their trashy app.  but ultimately you know they just want to take your money, because sex sells at the end of the day.

We have been dating now for several months and things look good. So I would definitely give this app 5 stars if that concluded the matter but that’s not where this ends. My partner and I decided to download our data from the app so we can keep the chat history as a reminder of our first conversations. He requested his on the app and received the data within a few days. I requested it and didn’t receive anything. I re-requested it and again didn’t receive anything. I emailed their support and they said I need to upload my photo ID to be able to receive my data. I am very uncomfortable with that. Also I didn’t use my legal name on the app. My name is very unique and with just that info and a couple of other personal details I can be found a little too easily on Google. So for my safety I never use my legal name online (protect yourselves if you also have a unique name, there are some major crazies out there). Anyways I told them I was not comfortable with this and how come my partner was able to download his data? They said because he requested it on the app. I said I requested it on the app too several times, at this point I think I’ve requested it at least 10 times. They said that they would “escalate the matter”. I just emailed them again for an update and they are saying I need to upload my ID. First of all, we’ve been through this several times already, it 100% feels like they do not fully read or grasp what I am saying on my email and second of all they said they were looking to correct this on 1/6/2022 and now I have to upload my ID? Why are we back to where we started? I am sad and disappointed because I really wanted my data. I sent my first email on 12/14/2021 and requested the data via the app starting in November. Still no resolution. I just reread my first email to them and I had told them from the beginning  that I had already requested my data via the app.",Hinge

Still a bummer how long it took to get to this point, but happy that I have now.

Two suggestions for devs:
1. Allow 2 profiles, one to be shown to men and one for women. I’m Bi (Kinsey 2) and looking for something different with men than woman.

2. Add a dietary restrictions option. I’d love to be able to filter for only vegan/vegetarian people.

Update 8 Jan. 2022: has been deleted for a while. Redownloaded last week & there’s still a disproportionate amount of unattractive people on here. I’ve sent about 5 likes and 2 roses (Hinge’s super-like) with no responses in the past week. This is likely cause women have no ability to filter out their likes or temporarily turn them off. If I do get a response, it’ll probably be a month from now.  I’m tall, conventional attractive, and have multiple points of interest listed on my profile for conversation starters. This app doesn’t care cause it’s method for match making is terrible inefficient. I’m looking to date and this app doesn’t help me with my goals.

8300435549,1/30/22 16:34,AdamStrickland,8.26.0,Hinge worked for me,5,"I’ll be honest, I had no faith in online dating or the prospect of meeting someone online that wasn’t shady but Hinge was great for me. I downloaded the app in December 2021 and quickly had several matches of quality people who fit what I was looking for, but one of the first people I met ended up being amazing and we quickly developed a strong relationship. They were one of the “recommended to me” persons and we hit it off immediately. 

Just a few ideas on my end for Hinge, now that I’m done with the app and it’s been deleted:

1- give a request for a deletion reason. Right now, when you delete the app, it’s just deleted, but I feel like it should be asking why you’re deleting so they can track the success of the app. Add me to the “don’t need it anymore” category. 

2- push users to take conversations offline. Right now, Hinge detects when a phone number is shared in chat and follows up asking if you met, but that’s it. I found a few conversations lingered in that “relationship Q&A” phase but Hinge should push users to migrate off the app and move. Maybe after 5-10 messages send a prompt to each user to say “enjoying the conversation? Maybe you should meet!” to take away some anxiety some users may have in moving forward. 

3- entice users to send messages with their likes. This isn’t Tinder; I had 10+ likes only with no comments. Those matches never pushed forward because the users weren’t trying to engage me, so I didn’t want to engage them. Bumble sends a “are your sure” message when you try to send just a simple “hey”, Hinge should prevent likes only. 

Great app, thanks to the developers for this as it’s been an awesome experience that I hope to never have to repeat!",Hinge

The features are great and when a match does happen it’s great, but that has become less frequent since Roses and Standouts. I understand they need revenue, but it was much better with a simple paid subscription and no paywall for “high ranked” standout profiles.

1. Hinge knows if you’re less attractive, and treats your profile as such
2. They put attractive people behind paywalls
3. You’ll rarely see “popular” (attractive) profiles unless you pay for the app
4. I’ve never heard a guy complain about “getting too many likes” - girls constantly have that problem - while guys MIGHT get a like or two over the course of multiple weeks.

To Hinge developers: Use your big smart algorithm to weed out the profiles that are OBVIOUSLY fake or long since inactive (another problem) instead of using it to

Let’s ignore their new money grab scheme and just stick with the basics. 

Pros: Women message first. Lots of quick stats you can look at if people fill them out. Good and easy UI. Lots of users in many areas due to popularity.

Cons: The app doesn’t force you to completely fill out the profile which leaves you looking at a lot of empty profiles. You can no longer use two free filters. Their customer support is non existent. If you don’t use your account for awhile they seem to autodelete it but not really because you have to use a new email. The app uses a ton of data so it appears there are several networking issues. The app crashes consistently and logs you out. Even when I have good service, I have trouble sending and receiving messages. There are a ton of couples/polys on the app especially in my area and there needs to be a separate gender filter for that. And last but not least (actually it’s the reason I updated this review): I’ve been banned from the app and they won’t tell me why and there’s no way to get unbanned from what I can tell.

Worse than that, you’ll find yourself reduced to 3-4 swipes per day after the initial onslaught of fake profiles you’re given when you first sign up.  Customer service will claim that this is to “encourage thoughtful swiping” when in reality it is designed to make you pay for a monthly subscription.  Remember: these apps don’t want you to find anyone; any users who find lasting relationships don’t keep using the app, and users who stop using the app don’t pay for subscriptions.  The sole purpose of this app is to separate fools from their money.  Don’t be one of those fools.",Bumble

My phone's location service does not work correctly (puts a state and town I am not in nor do I live in) and there is no way to manually input your location. I have tried reaching out to customer service about this issue and requested even if their tech support could override this and put my correct location in to which I only got a generic response that I needed to ensure my location was on for the app. I wish there were a way to manually put in a location or have a way to actually talk to someone on the app for issues but I guess for now I may need to look at other apps until this gets resolved.,Bumble

One suggestion I have is that when you’re first looking at the profile of someone and you scroll to the bottom you only have the option to swipe right or super swipe them but you can’t send them a message right then and there and that would be an improvement I think to have that option because the other person can still not respond if they don’t feel like you have enough in common and that’s it that’s all I have for you so far  - thanks..!",Bumble

8381347209,2/21/22 16:48,mivkarlk88,5.250.0,These apps are toxic money pits with no soul.,1,"These apps are fundamentally toxic and are most likely rigged. Most people look at a picture and take 3-5 seconds to tell if someone is worth even initiating a conversation with. Both sides have to agree that the other looks to their standards. You are making an app that you use a picture to determine if someone LOOKS good. Both sides have to agree on looks of the other. If either side says no for any reason, they can no longer talk and it’s a wasted connection. This is just the fundamental principle of this concept and is a reflection of a society and culture that only judges who they want to entertain based on LOOKS and nothing else. Any relationship that does get to happen will not be guaranteed to actually work as there’s more than someone than LOOKS. Society has made it so these and other apps are becoming the only means of social activity. No longer can you go out and physically see people and get to know them but that’s a whole other topic for other soapbox.

Now on to how the apps actually behave. You have to understand when someone swipes right on someone it doesn’t need to tell the other party that they said yes to you. The app and the backend could just ignore it and tell you that you have no results. The app can also limit who sees your profile and what profiles you get to see. The app can hide your profile even if you are using their paid priority show me first mechanic. This here adds to a system that already puts the odds in the favor of the house. If I’m spending actual real life money on this app, I should be shown first to everyone when they open the app similar to lightning lane or fastpass. For the amount of money paid for premium subscription, they shouldn’t be gatekeeping potential friends or otherwise and my profile should be shown to everyone and when me or someone swipes right, it should go through to the other person 100% of the time. A possible solution to that would be to show “people who you didn’t like who liked you” below people you didn’t already make a decision on. You can still make money and not be rigged like a slot machine. I would like more transparency in the app and would like to see more metrics like how many people liked or disliked me. Another thing you can do is add “why do you like/dislike this person” with 5 options so the other person can give constructive feedback or praise that they need to answer before going to the next person in line. The app and similar apps with similar to identical business models are toxic and are extremely harmful to a society of people with already low self confidence, anxiety and even sadly depression and social anxiety. If people are not liked on your apps, they might translate that to other social media and the real world and think they are worthless all because you want to make a buck and count beans. I know running an app and hiring people is not free but, like I said before you can still make money and let people actually connect to others. It shouldn’t be rocket science to find a friend or otherwise on your apps especially when you pay a premium to use them.",Bumble

I kid you not I get 1 match per month on this app and their response was my pictures are blurry. 
I really only date other girls of my culture just to make my parents happy but ya out of all the apps bumble had the weakest results and it’s bad cause I bought premium…

On Hinge I get 1-2 likes per day without premium and as a guy I guess that’s a lot versus the standard 100 per minute a girl gets.

Bumble said: use “clear photos” but my accurate guess is they did something to make my account show up less or they make it so your seen a lot when you first start using the app and when you make purchases. 

Try 
Hinge 
Culture specific dating apps (if you have to please your parents)
Tinder
- Bumble is at the bottom

End experience for a daily user for a month and I’ve had it for about 6 months

When two people match, there should be no further permission or confirmation needed in order to start chatting. We are adults, not children. If you do not want someone to message you, then do not swipe right on them. If you swiped right by accident and don’t want to talk to them, then simply unmatch with them. 99% of the time I match with someone, they never even send that first message, so the chat expires. Can someone explain what the point of that is? I watch match after match expire and I am not even allowed to reach out and send a message to someone who, after all, showed interest in me. Since men cannot initiate conversation I think it is abusing the service for women to swipe right on men and never send them a message. Was it just the little ego boost they were after anyway? It makes for a very frustrating experience for men as their hands are tied and they have no way of reaching out. What a childish game. Most women simply say something like ‘Hi’ as a first message anyway, which is fine, but this essentially means that they still want you to start the conversation after all. I believe most women don’t really want to message first, and if this is true then the rule is actually going against what most women want, making it even dumber. ‘Women message first’ is a stupid and pointless extra step in the process. I cannot see how simply being the first to message after you match with someone empowers the woman in any way. That’s not real empowerment, it’s pointless virtue signaling by Bumble.",Bumble

My female friends have said to me, “You pay to use Bumble?” This leads me to believe that females don’t have to pay to use the features of this app while men do. Please take my word of advice, steer clear of this app and use that money to go out and meet people in real life. Your money will be better spent.",Bumble

My profile did not show to the 5 profiles with no preferences and within 20 miles of me. Bumble clearly has the worst algorithm and profile shuffling for match making out of practically any dating app I’ve tried.

I’ve been on other dating apps that allow you to simply set where you live manually. Third, it runs on just a simple swipe mechanism. No liking specific parts of a profile or anything like that.

It’s worth it right? That’s when they get you… you buy the subscription and most of your likes are ugly and maybe 1 or 2 look great so you match with them. All of a sudden the good looking women disappear! So your stuck with the not so good looking ones ( if you didn’t get rid of them first lol) but even if you did it doesn’t matter because those women might talk to you for a couple of times that day but then nothing. Even the ugly ones go ghost. DONT WAIST YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!",Bumble

Apparently I am a match with a couple of but it only gives them 24 hours to message back and I just have to wait. I did have the opportunity to extend the time for another 24 hours. But It ran out. For some people finding a match is difficult. I feel like one of the main features is that women have the control over making the first move and also adding an additional time constraint on if unnecessary. To add insult to injury I have to watch the clock count down and really have nothing to do but watch it tick.  From my understanding I have expressed that I like her and she expressed that she like me via the app. For some reason this starts a clock.

One even just ended the chat the day of! 

It would be nice for the profile not to be limited to 3 questions to get to know the person more before swiping. There’s really not much to go off of except for looks and generic things that many people have in common. 

If the app is serious about connecting people for a potential relationship then allow the user to have the option to put as much as they want or as little as they want. And maybe real get-to-know-me questions too.. not only irrelevant, comedic ones. 

Guys on here seem too casual with bios having “don’t take life too seriously” as a common theme. I’ve gotten messages that make this app seem more like a place to hook up than actually meet a potential partner. 

Now I get that it’s not necessarily the app’s fault that guys on here don’t know proper manners when talking to women but again, it’s the lack of information in the profile that makes this app rely more on physical attraction rather than letting personality show.

One more thing, instead of waiting for the woman to make the move, I wouldn’t mind hearing from the guy first too. Especially if they swiped first. in a way, matching with them (or accepting their match so to speak) is just another way of saying, “sure I’ll chat with you”",Bumble

(Messages, matches, etc) 
I had befriended one on Instagram who told me my messages was not going through to them on Bumble Business.

I decided to upgrade and get the life membership. (To save money long term)
And to be able to connect with more people.

They advertise and suggest these features are truly unlimited when it’s not.

If you are on the free version they cap you on daily activity.

If you use the premium they see doing too much activity as spam. And can block you from the app  at any time without warning.

Due to all the technical issues I was having and people not getting my messages on the app.
I suggested people could reach out to me on Instagram or continue to speak here within the app.
(You can have your Instagram attached to your profile. Which would mean anyone could see your Instagram if they desired to.)
Which is why I ONLY shared a partnered app as an additional means of communication due to Bumbles technical issues.
I would of been more patient, however connections do expire if you do not message them promptly.

In all if I did it all over I would of stuck with the free version and only reach out to 5-10 people daily. And would of asked the other person their desired means of communication and not directly giving my own.

I have one major concern with Bumble: the “religion” filter should NOT be behind the paywall. I don’t want to waste time looking at profiles of people who don’t know Christ, because it’s ultimately a waste of time and disappointment. I want a relationship that can lead to marriage, and that isn’t happening if we’re unevenly yoked — so why even go there? Please move this filter to the free part of the app. It’s the ONLY paid feature I care about, and I’m not paying for something so simple that should be free.

Other than that big issue, the rest seems fine as far as I’ve seen. The biggest issue isn’t something they can fix, it’s an issue with my area and the demographic here.

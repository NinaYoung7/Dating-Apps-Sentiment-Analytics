I was hitting it off hard with this girl, and then unmatched with her on accident, and there is no way to go back and undo it, so I‚Äôll probably never talk to her again"
8563038740,2022-04-13 14:38:25,"Evilknights","13.5.0","Don't trust the 5-star rating",1,"This app has been 2 stars and below since they went for the pay to play method. They just delete all of their bad reviews and have their PR make multiple accounts for good reviews. Also, this app spams you with more and more useless notifications in a sad attempt to get you to use it. There is nothing more annoying than being woken up in the middle of the night just to see ""you have more swipes come use our subpar app."" Stop being money hungry and give an option to turn off your terrible notifications trying to get me to use your app. If it's not a pretty girl talking to me, then I don't want tinder notifying me.

Edit: this has literally became one of the buggiest, worst apps I have ever seen. Continuously adding useless content, constantly logs you out and ask you to reconnect with Facebook then just says ""account already given permission"" doesn't load things, filled with insane amounts of spam accounts, and ask you leave a review literally every time you use it even if you already have. Don't download this, and definitely do not support the developers.

Edit 2: got banned for telling a girl ""you are not in my dating bracket."" I've had this for 5 years.

Edit 3: the number of swipes have been reduced dramatically. You only get about 10-15 right swipes now. Still a terrible app."

Tinder loves notifying you of all the matches they block, I‚Äôm at 89 now.

I‚Äôve been on two dates and that was before the ‚Äúmeetup‚Äù epidemic, for the last 3-4 years tinder has slowly developed into the grand daddy pimp of entitled gold diggers. We have to face the music, here. This is a gray area fa√ßade for prostitution. There is nobody monitoring or disallowing this behavior, guys can‚Äôt even post a shirtless photo yet these girls with their parts out are sliding by because it brings traffic to the consumer base."
8555669828,2022-04-11 11:56:23,"Louis R. Tursi","13.4.0","There‚Äôs no harm in giving it a try.",4,"To the general public, here is what I have to say. The experience one may have on an app like Tinder is subjective. It‚Äôs different for everybody and can highly depend on where you are located, your profile, your intent, etc. Males beware: do not be surprised when the majority of women you ask to hook up with you decline. Females beware: do not be surprised when the majority of men‚Äîor rather, boys‚Äîask you if you‚Äôre down to hook up. Whatever gender you are, whichever gender you are seeking, and whatever your intention with an app like this is, do not set your expectations high. Download it, swipe based on your interests, close the app, and go about the rest of your day and just see what happens. If it goes well, great! If it doesn‚Äôt, so what? Tinder is not the end-all-be-all, and that is my best advice.

Regarding the app itself though, as someone who has been using it on and off for a little over three years as of writing this, I‚Äôm surprised that it‚Äôs still as incredibly buggy as it is given that it was released over a decade ago. For example, the notification badges on it get stuck on a random high number for no reason, despite me having opened all of my matches and reading all my messages. As of late, the information within the app does not even update. In other words, I‚Äôll receive a new notification that I‚Äôve gotten a new match or that someone has sent me a new message, and upon opening the app, nothing has changed. I have tried signing out and signing back in, deleting the app completely (followed by waiting a while) and reinstalling it, and I‚Äôve even contacted support regarding all these issues and they were just about as helpful as my dog‚Äôs sh*t.

To conclude, I personally love what this app has brought and contributed to my life. I don‚Äôt know what my life would be like today without it, but I can guarantee it would not be the way it is now; far from it, in fact. I‚Äôve been using it for nearly three years and have had a blast with it since I first signed up for it. With all that being said, just try it already. It really couldn‚Äôt hurt; I honestly don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre still waiting for. (Plus, you‚Äôve read this entire review for a reason, did you not?)

To the developers, all I have to say to you is... fix the functionality issues already. You update this app like once every two weeks claiming you‚Äôve ""fixed bugs"" (without any further explanation). Stop lying to make yourself look good, please and thank you."

The main issue with the app is that there are too many annoying and repetitive bugs that completely destroy the user experience. 

First off, why even have an option to ‚Äúonly show people in this range‚Äù if every other profile you show is 2000+ miles away from the range I set? I mean, I get it. The app runs out of users to show you after a while and is forced to recommend profiles outside the range. But then why not just say that the app has run out of profiles and leave it at that? My guess is that the devs are trying way too hard to waste people‚Äôs time and keep them on the app as long as possible.

Second, literally every other swipe I get a notification that says ‚ÄúSuper like to increase your odds by 5x.‚Äù Now, I personally wouldn‚Äôt care about the constant notification. But it‚Äôs literally right above the profiles distance for you. Which is the number. one. consideration. when deciding on whether to swipe right or not. Again, this goes back to my initial theory that the devs are looking for ways to keep users on the app. 

I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve logging out and back in, deleted the app and it‚Äôs data. Nothing fixes these issues, because they‚Äôre not bugs, they‚Äôre features."

Just to provide one example if memory serves, you used to get five free super-likes a day now you have to pay to even get one; I refuse to pump money into any of these dating apps both on principle and because who on earth would trust them with their payment info when their app is this much of a glitchy mess?"

That experience cost me $25. Don‚Äôt waste your money on an app with such bad development resources that they can‚Äôt ensure the core functionality even remotely works.

My account was banned. I have the most vanilla account on the planet and was certain it was an error. Tinder responded and admitted it was their error and that my account was banned (forever) because it was accidentally flagged as a spam account.

Then they proceed to tell me to sign up again, but that‚Äôs impossible because you have to use your phone number to sign up (you can‚Äôt use a burn number) and my phone number is forever banned. 

So thanks Tinder for having the worst algorithm on the planet that bans real accounts FOREVER with no way for those people to ever get back on the app.

You have an obligation to have a more sensitive and compassionate process around this. You know many of the people on your app are already feeling rejected, lonely, and depressed, and you make it worse by banning them from a way to connect with others and accusing them of doing something they didn‚Äôt do. It‚Äôs so wrong on so many levels. 

I mean does anyone on your team actually read these reviews?! You would think you would change the process of banning accounts by now given the thousands of complaints that say they all experienced the exact same thing."

Sometimes my profile will be shown at random times and I'll get 10 like within half an hour, but this doesn't happen too often and I'll only get a couple a day. The culture has also changed around it for the worse, many years ago it was super easy to have a bunch of matches that led to conversations that led to dates. Now almost none of the matches reply to my messages, and the ones that end up planning a date often cancel or don't show up to the date. I'm quite tired of feeling burnt out by this app and really don't see much of a future with it for myself or perhaps with other men that may be having the same experiences.

Its user interface encouraged a dialogue both in the forms of prompts and easy-to-engage photography seen on profiles.

For every 10 potential matches for men, maybe 4 or 5 would be of interest.

So what happened?

Like most apps nowadays, Hinge got to work on ‚Äúimproving‚Äù its algorithm(s). The aim, obvious as it may seem, was to produce BETTER user experiences by matching users with seemingly similar traits, interests, and (purely subjective) ‚Äúlevels of attractiveness‚Äù.

And now, for every 10 potential matches for men - *maybe* 1 is of interest (the experience reported by multiple male users).

What it did not take into consideration is the demographic breakdown of its users: roughly 65% are men while the remaining 35% are female (according to Hinge itself).

This disparity is also heightened by basic gender preferences, primarily the 80/20 principle, in that 20% of the men receive 80% of the attention of women (think of high school and how all of the girls wanted to date the boys on the football team).

In summary, the apps algorithm(s) have made matching a one-way street in which the women get plenty of potential matches with people of similar or higher attractiveness, whereas men do not.

So if you‚Äôre a female searching for a male - you‚Äôll have no problem.

If you‚Äôre a male searching for a female - you‚Äôd have better odds of meeting a woman at an all-male prep academy."

I highly doubt they ‚Äòcarefully‚Äô reevaluated my profile within those 7 minutes while responding with a paragraph response.

Besides the unfairness of the developers a complaint I have is the distance settings. I have it set to where if there are no people left within the distance then no profiles should show up.

Second: BOTS! I‚Äôve seen a significant increase in the number of bots since I started using. And they‚Äôre usually in the Standouts. This morning I noticed at least 3-4 in the mix. They‚Äôre always extremely conventionally attractive, from another country, their personal info has something nonsensical in it, the prompts mention marriage or long term relationships, and pics feature them w/animals.

After being on here for a couple/few months, Hinge more and more started to send me men I found attractive and was more likely to have good conversation with. I met a guy that I really like, and we‚Äôve been seeing each other for less than a couple months but I have never met a man who I could talk to for hours on end like this. We did the video calls and the questioning game through Hinge and eventually met up for a social distanced picnic."

I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs in a drive to push you towards the paid version, but originally the app would show a mix of people, some I‚Äôd be interested in and some I wouldn‚Äôt. Now days all the app shows are people I‚Äôd rank 3/10 or less. It‚Äôs very clear that this isn‚Äôt ‚Äúby chance‚Äù or that it‚Äôs a balanced representation of the people around me, as the standouts feature ALWAYS has people that aren‚Äôt repulsive, but this now seems to be the only place on this app that you find them. 

Sorry honey, I don‚Äôt find a 5‚Äô5‚Äù girl weighing 230lbs attractive and I don‚Äôt think many do‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ I would prefer these aren‚Äôt the only girls that show up on my regular feed.  It‚Äôs as though by showing you all the undesirables, they think people are going to pay to unlock the less ugly people‚Ä¶.. really? If you are playing these tricks before I pay, what tricks do you play after I‚Äôve paid and I can‚Äôt get a refund. It seems as though they also stop most matches going through as I used to get a response to a good proportion of likes, but now I never get a reply. The same goes for receiving likes. I originally used to receive a few likes a week yet over the last many months don‚Äôt receive any. I find it hard to believe my unchanged profile would have suddenly dropped all its appeal.

Either the developers have accidentally ruined this app, or more likely, the executives intentionally ruined it by trying to force you into the paid version- ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs our next plan in the quest for MONEY? I know, let‚Äôs stop showing people that would actually match with each other and then bombard them with the option to upgrade so they have to give us $ in order to actually get use out of this app‚Äù.

One thing I do find interesting is that new users haven‚Äôt had time to be profiled by the hinge algorithm yet so hinge still shows them to everybody until it realizes they are attractive and stashes them away where they won‚Äôt show except for the expensive standouts section. 

Don‚Äôt download this app, or if you do, make the most of the first couple of weeks you have it. After that you may as well delete it because all you‚Äôre gonna find are uglies & fatsos or at least the opposite of the type of people you were originally trying to match with.

It seems as though hinge have implemented a new algorithm that pushes the least ‚Äúswiped right‚Äù users to the very front. This will sound vain, but in the past I used to get a mix of attractive and unattractive girls showing. The last month or so it has been purely unattractive girls, as in, the most unattractive that you without a doubt swipe left on immediately.  

I‚Äôm not gonna sugar coat it: 
This would make sense to improve statistics, as if all the regular/ hot girls are always getting matches and the uggos are not, the app won‚Äôt meet whatever goals the corporation have set for number of matches, therefore they push the uggos so they have the best chance of finding a match, and barely show the hotties seeing as they are likely to get many matches from just minimal exposure. 

I myself used to get many matches, albeit from uggos who probably match with any 5 or above. However in the last month or so I haven‚Äôt even been  getting these. It straight dropped off. This algorithm would also fit this situation as I was getting too many matches so I have been dropped to the ‚Äúshow least‚Äù or at-least ‚Äúshow less‚Äù pool. 

Don‚Äôt bother signing up for this app unless you have a ‚Äúthing‚Äù for what the majority of society deem ‚Äúunattractive‚Äù. The developers may have some politically/ socially responsible response and claim something else, but we all know the PR machine is strong with large corporations so take their reply with a grain (or many) of salt.

The ‚Äúalgorithm‚Äù is terrible (and I‚Äôm an attractive, educated woman).  I tried this app for a few months (both paid and free) bc I had heard it was the app to go on to find a relationship but the way the app works, I found very non conducive to maximizing matches. Notifying each time you send a ‚Äúlike‚Äù made me less likely to send one if I was on the fence. I have gone on so many actual dates on Tinder and Bumble. With Hinge, I went on zero and had much fewer matches.  The conversations I had were lackluster and sometimes w men who were hours away.  I paid for 3 months to see all the likes I received at the same time and thinking I‚Äôd want to have more than 8 likes per day but I barely could find one per day.  (It was more like one per week).

Don‚Äôt waste your money on buying extra roses.  The app makes you think you should buy them to match with the ‚Äústand outs‚Äù but those people get recycled and show up again and again. I‚Äôm not even sure they‚Äôre all real profiles.  It‚Äôs a great marketing ploy but seems a bit like a scam. There‚Äôs no way to know if the person received the rose, if you‚Äôre outside their preferences. Also, the person gets a notification that a rose was sent to them from you and that it‚Äôs extra special - so embarrassing (I only know this bc someone sent me one).  It won‚Äôt help you w getting more dates, believe me.  

Guess there‚Äôs an app for everyone but this is not the one for me. Hope others have better luck but learn from my mistake and don‚Äôt waste your time or money on extra roses bc of the ‚Äústand outs‚Äù list that you are sent."

The fact that you have to pay for additional roses beyond the one you get from time to time isn‚Äôt even what bothers me, but it is the obligation to use a rose because it comes off as desperate and cheesy and I‚Äôve NEVER had a match from a rose or super-like. It completely sabotages your chance with a girl to send a rose, so it makes these girls completely off limits. 
I actually had a girl from my ‚ÄúStandouts‚Äù like me organically, so I was able to match her and we had a couple of nice dates before it didn‚Äôt work out, but that was the most exciting match with the best potential I‚Äôve had from using this app and it never could have happened from my own initiation.

So far so good. Then I came across a profile with 5 lackluster photos and a 6th photo that made the person look like a model. Maybe it was catfishing, but I liked the photo and told the person it was a really great shot and they should put it up higher. The women responded with a tirade about how men don‚Äôt get to decide what‚Äôs a good photo or not, What the F**k, go to H**l, etc. I responded tongue and cheek and thought it was over. A day later I was banned. No warning, no temporary suspension, banned for life! It didn‚Äôt matter than 15 other women had matched with me. One woman flagged me, and I was gone without even an explanation. Cancel culture at its best! Hinge hides behind the claim it is protecting women but in reality it is disrespecting men. It didn‚Äôt even respect the women that had matched with me by giving them an explanation or a way to keep in touch. One woman that I had been texting with off the app, contacted me and asked why I unmatched with her. Hinge does some things right, but like many other hi-tech behemoths they think they own you, and they basically do.

The discover page has always been a mixed bag, some people aren't your type and some are, that's life. However, between standouts Ave the recent update, that no longer seems to be the case. The discover feed is filled with brand new accounts (which is fine, they've been the closest to the type of people I tend to match with) or accounts that are significantly different from any person I've ever matched with on the app. From incomplete profiles, to basic answer incompatibilities and an algorithm that clearly knows your preferences but ignores them behind a paywall. I purchased the premium model and I'm currently using it, I don't recommend. My best matches are in preferred, which is nice but I never see any of them in the feed and even with a premium account, you only get one way to match with you ""preferred match"" for free for a week. So, you'll see about 70 profiles that you really like in a week and you're only able to reach out to one, even with premium. It seems to me that the hinge algorithm has gotten better, as the preferred page has really good matches. However, that algorithm seems to go out the window for discover. For anyone who likes/liked this app, I'd recommend getting the free version. You'll save money and annoyance, you might even see more people that you like. It seems like I was served more people who are a good match before I paid, I'm assuming it's a way to make sure that free users see enough people that they like to think that it's worth it. It's not. You'll likely swipe through a sea of profiles are largely not what you're looking for only to be annoyed that you paid and still can't even send a basic like to your preferred matches.

I understand that any dating app will have much more unattractive people than it does attractive. Wouldn‚Äôt it be more worth while to show the unattractive profiles to each other?

The first time, finding matches was relatively easy and consistent and I met some really great people. I entered a relationship with one of them for a couple years and deleted the app.

A few months ago I redownloaded Bumble and Hinge. My experience with Bumble this time around has been pretty abysmal. The very first day there was an influx of likes, and in the weeks since I've received around 5 total. Compare this with Hinge, where likes are more direct than a simple right swipe, yet I receive them on a daily basis. I use the same photos on both apps; the only difference is the apps themselves.

That influx of likes you get your first day on Bumble seems very manipulative considering your profile will likely not receive that kind of attention ever again.

But my main problem was the unexplained censorship. I used a photo that was perfectly fine on match, hinge, and coffee meets bagel but not Bumble. They refused to explain why they were taking the photo down when I messaged them and I looked up the guidelines and my photo was perfectly fine. Bumble must have some Puritan standards because that extremism is the only way the photo could be considered inappropriate. I guess my halloween costume as a vampire bunny from the ribcage up was just too raunchy for their Puritan standards. Must gave been the exposed shoulders and uncovered collar bones. That or the moderation system is a really catty insecure person.

- unlike Hinge you have to pay to see who likes you. $20 per WEEK is the cheapest.

Two major problems I see are 

1) the use of meaningless hieroglyphic icons that seem to randomly switch around on every page makes navigation very tedious and difficult; WHEN will developers learn to use text menus that we can just look at to see what they‚Äôre for, instead of having to experiment by clicking on every one to see if they do something useful or are what we‚Äôre looking for?  A single drop down text menu in the upper left corner where menus belong would be a massive improvement in usability, instead of scattering meaningless hieroglyphs randomly around the screen. 

2) poor contrast of light yellow-orangey text on white backgrounds in Setup areas makes certain operations slow and difficult. Not as bad as the use of meaningless icons, but still unnecessary. Suspect the developer isn‚Äôt using naive testers on a variety of devices like he should, but instead is probably developing on a Mac with a high contrast screen where his light-on-light text is discernible and where the use of meaningless hieroglyphics for navigation has long been standard practice‚Äîand the reason that I and many others loathe Apple products."

But what really gets me here, is the way they handle gender identity and how they categorize it. I‚Äôm a trans male, who‚Äôs interested in women, and I‚Äôve had no problems in my past with dating women. But if I change my gender identity to ‚Äútrans man‚Äù on this app and set my preference as ‚Äúwomen‚Äù my feed is changed to nothing but other women who are interested in women, or people looking for ‚Äúpoly‚Äù relationships. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm quite what lesbians are looking for bumble? But once I set my gender back to ‚Äúmale‚Äù I‚Äôm brought back to women who are interested in men.

Now I‚Äôd rank Bumble below Hinge and Tinder in terms of overall experience.

8488490401,2022-03-24 00:51:00,"WesleyG92","5.256.0","Bumble BFF is Homophobic",2,"Bumble BFF inherently recognizes that people need to make friends, new friends. This is especially crucial when for example you move or enter a period of new growth. And BFF inherently recognizes that people sometimes are solely looking for friends where sex can never be an option and harassment is a nonstarter, hence it limits matches only to the same gender. That only works for heterosexual people, and there is no way to change that setting. Cis-identifying queer people have no way of seeking platonic friendships safe from the risk of harassment or sexual pressure. And the utilization of the binary completely removes choice and sense of belonging for trans and non-binary folx for whom harassment and sexual pressure are never off the table anyways.

In short, why is the platonic side of this app geared first and foremost with cis-hets in mind, with virtually no liberty for queer people? Do we not deserve friends of our own choosing? Are we inherently incapable of making lasting and deep friendships with others of different gender identities?? Bumble BFF answers the latter two questions with a resounding YES. Shameful."

On top of all this it never shows you anyone with similar interests, maybe 1 out of 20 people shown will have similar interests and wants as you.

In real life u get approached everyday by men if you are attractive and that will be the same on a dating app so why is that a bad thing?

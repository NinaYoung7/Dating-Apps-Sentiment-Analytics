However, after several matches with different “girls”, I’ve noticed that some girls names show the same name over and over again. (from Allison to Maddison and etc). Moreover, I feel that Tinder doesn’t care if scammers use this app to lure different people to talk to them, which could lead to potential dangers of our lives. Although this app was good at first, but it strategically fell down hill. So, if Tinder is listening, upgrade your security measures to ensure the safety of other people’s identity and identify the scammers.","Tinder"

8413352687,"2022-03-02 18:20:33","Catastrobri","13.1.0","Glitchy App",1,"UPDATE - Nevermind. I am completely baffled by Tinder. I emailed and reported the technological errors I was encountering and 12 hours later they emailed me back notifying that my account was suddenly banned for “violating community guidelines”. I reviewed every single guideline and I had never once violated a single one. I have never once sent an inappropriate, offensive, or derogatory message. I have never once misrepresented myself. But I am suddenly banned after reporting technological errors. 

Men can get on this app and message you the most obscene and offense things and manage to keep their accounts and continue to terrorize women. But god forbid you report technological errors? 

———————————————-
Some of the reviews here are a bit confusing. It’s a bit strange to give an app a bad review for your poor dating results. 

My review stems from the sole factor of the app being SO GLITCHY! I have the worst time with this app after the past few updates.

- I’ll get notifications for messages that won’t load on the screen for DAYS. Like, no new messages will show for DAYS. When I check- the sent time will be from days prior but just show up right then. 
- I’ll get asked to “verify I’m human” and it’ll just glitch out and keep asking over and over and over until you uninstall and reinstall the app! 
- Sometimes pictures won’t upload.

It makes it super frustrating to use!","Tinder"

The ad revenue isn’t enough for them and my friends that have been successful on the app after it became a cash grab paid for boosts (they lied about it ofc, but I caught them in their lie). I used to have pretty good luck on here back when Tinder was relatively new, but now it’s just a waste of time and after the first day of being a free member it’s clear no one sees my profile (I’ll rack up likes the first day, then suddenly nothing). It’s obvious why it works this way and resetting your account doesn’t cut it anymore. Tinder also has next to zero respect for GDPR and won’t disclose all of the information they keep on you (Google it). I wouldn’t be surprised if they are doing shady things with your information (which includes their method of sabotaging the effectiveness of a profile reset).","Tinder"

The experience: after receiving only 1 or maybe 2 likes daily, I thought there must be something wrong. I deleted my account and recreated. Did the same with bumble so all variables were the same. Nothing changed, one and maybe 2 likes per day. Bumble.., over 50, yes 5 - 0 likes per day. And not just any likes, high quality ladies 8+!

Both profiles were identical with same photos, EVERYTHING the same.

I’m a good looking guy and just found it odd I had very little activity on tinder and had to try this little experiment. Even with a boost, tinder was no match for bumble

What I mean by that is - this is a dating app right? Where you go to meet people to, ya know, date?

If you’re a woman and you ghost men they often get mad and report you.  There’s absolutely no way to dispute a ban and you get no explanation or warning. It can just happen one day.  Also, if you put anything controversial in your bio you may be at risk.

I see the same guys I swipe no on over and over…and over. It doesn’t give the option to hide them or remove them. I can’t block the perverts, the married men, or the couples looking for sex. 
I can’t remove the same guys I have zero in common with. Nope, every week I have to swipe X on them again. No filters exist to remove guys with kids, smokers, or keywords like hunting, and it just wastes my time. It also keeps offering me the same three guys I reported for harassment.

Even my honest and tame response to that was met with Cyd’s “final notice we won’t respond”.

All to a $30 paying customer with over a year flawless track record…. People looking to Tinder should be ware. My experience Tinder took my money for using their tools, banned me, and told me to go to Apple for a disputed refund. What kind of business works like this?","Tinder"

Please don’t tempt yourself into it. You should not be spending a dime on an app who’s sole purpose is to ensure that you are spending the most time of your life on it and nothing else. 

Trust me, they don’t want you getting any matches. 

The app is filled with at least 80% men, in which women are only shown the top 10%. Although you may be the most attractive out of your social group, tinder will be there to reassure you that you are not as interesting as you may seem. It came to the point where simply swiping for a minute or two lowered my self-esteem drastically. Talk about an ego crusher.

Tinder needs an “Unmatched” section where you can see those who have unmatched you and the conversation. Let them put in a reason for unmatching you or allow them to select “No I don’t want this person to see why I unmatched” or whatever.

I really appreciate the level of service which comes with the paid version, so if you want to leverage your finances and care enough to do so, this has one of the better levels of service for paid users. I’m going to ask for more features I’d love to see here: I would also really enjoy being able to filter based on career and education. I would also enjoy the ability to for users to select options for how long they want their next relationship to last. ie. “One night. A few months or years. Several years. Rest of my life. Open to what happens.” I’d also like to be able to filter based on that. I think with these additions, this platform can start becoming a competitor for people looking for serious matches as well. I also think that it will create a better user experience for people, so they don’t wasted their time with people who aren’t looking for the same thing. ———————— Previous request which was listened to and developed.

A psycho lady who is over 39 years old and obviously is not mentally stable to be on the app, chatted me up . We had a conversation and each time I try to bring up to meet she never wants to, unfortunately she kept texting me for 2-weeks sending pictures and all that and making pressures to know my intimate life , I said I don’t tell strangers much about me without knowing them face to face. We had a meeting to meet and I said ok , a day to meet she kept love bombing and asking for me to take her on an expensive date, I told her sorry I can’t come and respectfully, luckily for me I always keep chats and proof since we are in the crazy era of dating. I simple said I can’t pick her up, all because she saw me living good , and driving exotic cars after FaceTiming me several times asking my whereabouts which gave me a panic like some scheme is being plotted I woke up to see tinder saying my account was banned , I appealed and sent proof that she was even the one violating me, tinder still replies a verified account with a blue check and my pictures there that I violated and that my account is banned. I am livid and say it is quite a horrible experience , that even in the face of evidence tinder places unfair biased judgement .. I would have let the account go … but it is to let tinder know the horrible service they provide and I don’t think I might be on the app again … keep it up to let mentally deranged females to be spoiling the app, and even with evidence keep supporting an agenda that obviously with time will make you run out of business… Like what the h+ll ? !!!

I wouldn’t say people not to use your services , but to let them know how a false accusation and even with evidence it is never going well for the victim all because a female is the one that reported.

The “algorithm” is terrible (and I’m an attractive, educated woman).  I tried this app for a few months (both paid and free) bc I had heard it was the app to go on to find a relationship but the way the app works, I found very non conducive to maximizing matches. Notifying each time you send a “like” made me less likely to send one if I was on the fence. I have gone on so many actual dates on Tinder and Bumble. With Hinge, I went on zero and had much fewer matches.  The conversations I had were lackluster and sometimes w men who were hours away.  I paid for 3 months to see all the likes I received at the same time and thinking I’d want to have more than 8 likes per day but I barely could find one per day.  (It was more like one per week).

Don’t waste your money on buying extra roses.  The app makes you think you should buy them to match with the “stand outs” but those people get recycled and show up again and again. I’m not even sure they’re all real profiles.  It’s a great marketing ploy but seems a bit like a scam. There’s no way to know if the person received the rose, if you’re outside their preferences. Also, the person gets a notification that a rose was sent to them from you and that it’s extra special - so embarrassing (I only know this bc someone sent me one).  It won’t help you w getting more dates, believe me.  

Guess there’s an app for everyone but this is not the one for me. Hope others have better luck but learn from my mistake and don’t waste your time or money on extra roses bc of the “stand outs” list that you are sent.","Hinge"

The fact that you have to pay for additional roses beyond the one you get from time to time isn’t even what bothers me, but it is the obligation to use a rose because it comes off as desperate and cheesy and I’ve NEVER had a match from a rose or super-like. It completely sabotages your chance with a girl to send a rose, so it makes these girls completely off limits. 
I actually had a girl from my “Standouts” like me organically, so I was able to match her and we had a couple of nice dates before it didn’t work out, but that was the most exciting match with the best potential I’ve had from using this app and it never could have happened from my own initiation.

The fact that you need to engage with people by text messaging to match, instead of just swiping leads to more interesting connections. After a few weeks I had 15 matches and 5 dates set up. So far so good. Then I came across a profile with 5 lackluster photos and a 6th photo that made the person look like a model. Maybe it was catfishing, but I liked the photo and told the person it was a really great shot and they should put it up higher. The women responded with a tirade about how men don’t get to decide what’s a good photo or not, What the F**k, go to H**l, etc. I responded tongue and cheek and thought it was over. A day later I was banned. No warning, no temporary suspension, banned for life! It didn’t matter than 15 other women had matched with me. One woman flagged me, and I was gone without even an explanation. Cancel culture at its best! Hinge hides behind the claim it is protecting women but in reality it is disrespecting men. It didn’t even respect the women that had matched with me by giving them an explanation or a way to keep in touch. One woman that I had been texting with off the app, contacted me and asked why I unmatched with her. Hinge does some things right, but like many other hi-tech behemoths they think they own you, and they basically do. They can cancel you without notice or an explanation and you don’t even get access to the the data and connections you made. Before you get too invested in this app, take a look at the board of directors. A bunch or corporate suits that don’t look like they have been on a date since the 80s. Then do yourself a favor and delete the app before you waste your time. Who would have known that’s what they meant when they said the app was designed to be deleted.","Hinge"

The discover page has always been a mixed bag, some people aren't your type and some are, that's life. However, between standouts Ave the recent update, that no longer seems to be the case. The discover feed is filled with brand new accounts (which is fine, they've been the closest to the type of people I tend to match with) or accounts that are significantly different from any person I've ever matched with on the app. From incomplete profiles, to basic answer incompatibilities and an algorithm that clearly knows your preferences but ignores them behind a paywall. I purchased the premium model and I'm currently using it, I don't recommend. My best matches are in preferred, which is nice but I never see any of them in the feed and even with a premium account, you only get one way to match with you ""preferred match"" for free for a week. So, you'll see about 70 profiles that you really like in a week and you're only able to reach out to one, even with premium. It seems to me that the hinge algorithm has gotten better, as the preferred page has really good matches. However, that algorithm seems to go out the window for discover. For anyone who likes/liked this app, I'd recommend getting the free version. You'll save money and annoyance, you might even see more people that you like. It seems like I was served more people who are a good match before I paid, I'm assuming it's a way to make sure that free users see enough people that they like to think that it's worth it. It's not. You'll likely swipe through a sea of profiles are largely not what you're looking for only to be annoyed that you paid and still can't even send a basic like to your preferred matches.

I understand that any dating app will have much more unattractive people than it does attractive. Wouldn’t it be more worth while to show the unattractive profiles to each other?

I truly wish I could post pictures to show you guys the evidence I have gathered to back all this up but as you use the app you will notice it as well. I find it odd that hinge has 2 categories of defining people…. There is the regular H  category at the bottom left where majority of people swipe on people and such and it’s the main interaction place (in theory). Then they have the “Star” category which is hinges EXCLUSIVE members that are supposed to be better matches for you! (In theory). But as you use the app, notice you probably swipe around 70/90 times in the H category before even swiping right once, and in the star category it’s ALWAYS the woman or men that you truly find attractive in all areas… the app after the first 30 people you like and try to match with understands “your type” or the type of people you find attractive and kind and who’s personality is what you’re looking for. That’s the point of the app to find the GOOD matches for you. But what they don’t tell you or want to admit is. Once they find out you’re type and such they actually  throw the complete opposites types of people at you untill you have spent enough time and money on the app then the app rewards you with “COMPATIBLE matches” what I’m trying to explain here is that Hinge is deliberately sending you the opposite types of people to you because they need more users spending time in the app then actully matching. Their target audience are desperate people who have had 0 luck still in their dating lives and have moved on from other apps like tinder And  okcupid and such etc…  Hinge knows exactly what they are doing and it’s wasting our times and taking our money because there are enough desperate people to off set things. It actually makes me very sad to see how many opportunities we miss because we don’t pay them 20$. Multiple people, friends, family etc… can also confirm that 90% of hinges H matches for you are the opposite attractiveness, opposite personality type etc etc…. It shocks me how such an app can be so successful due to people in such desperation that they are will to go throw 70/90 people before swiping right on even one compared to paying 20$ for the “star” category.

Not as many likes as other apps so if you match with someone, they have chosen you more carefully than other apps that allow you to like every single person you pass through. You can put distance settings for free and reverse a pass. If you run out of people it gives you an option to see the people you passed again or you can put the distance setting further. The bulk of the things you need to find matches and talk with people is free. Again, only thing that appears like a downside is there are less likes but I do think it actually helps people choose more carefully what they are looking for, and take the choices more seriously.

The only issue is Hinge has a much smaller user base. It is a more tight knit and less superficial community, which I appreciate, but it is easier to run out of people. New people do join fairly often so it’s nice to see some new faces every week. 

Other than that, it’s a fantastic app, I hope they keep it this way!","Hinge"

When I receive roses, it’s an automatic no. Gross. Everyone I know who uses Hinge hates the rose feature and finds it cringy, so of course I’m never going to send one. It basically dooms a relationship, even if we might be compatible. So I don’t send them, because I know the people I match with will find it gross. See the problem?

8304372881,"2022-01-31 18:18:16","SJMReviews","8.26.0","Found my partner but customer service is terrible",1,"I downloaded this app on a whim and was lucky to find a person I really liked. We have been dating now for several months and things look good. So I would definitely give this app 5 stars if that concluded the matter but that’s not where this ends. My partner and I decided to download our data from the app so we can keep the chat history as a reminder of our first conversations. He requested his on the app and received the data within a few days. I requested it and didn’t receive anything. I re-requested it and again didn’t receive anything. I emailed their support and they said I need to upload my photo ID to be able to receive my data. I am very uncomfortable with that. Also I didn’t use my legal name on the app. My name is very unique and with just that info and a couple of other personal details I can be found a little too easily on Google. So for my safety I never use my legal name online (protect yourselves if you also have a unique name, there are some major crazies out there). Anyways I told them I was not comfortable with this and how come my partner was able to download his data? They said because he requested it on the app. I said I requested it on the app too several times, at this point I think I’ve requested it at least 10 times. They said that they would “escalate the matter”. I just emailed them again for an update and they are saying I need to upload my ID. First of all, we’ve been through this several times already, it 100% feels like they do not fully read or grasp what I am saying on my email and second of all they said they were looking to correct this on 1/6/2022 and now I have to upload my ID? Why are we back to where we started? I am sad and disappointed because I really wanted my data. I sent my first email on 12/14/2021 and requested the data via the app starting in November. Still no resolution. I just reread my first email to them and I had told them from the beginning  that I had already requested my data via the app.","Hinge"

Still a bummer how long it took to get to this point, but happy that I have now.

Two suggestions for devs:
1. Allow 2 profiles, one to be shown to men and one for women. I’m Bi (Kinsey 2) and looking for something different with men than woman.

2. Add a dietary restrictions option. I’d love to be able to filter for only vegan/vegetarian people.

Update 8 Jan. 2022: has been deleted for a while. Redownloaded last week & there’s still a disproportionate amount of unattractive people on here. I’ve sent about 5 likes and 2 roses (Hinge’s super-like) with no responses in the past week. This is likely cause women have no ability to filter out their likes or temporarily turn them off. If I do get a response, it’ll probably be a month from now.  I’m tall, conventional attractive, and have multiple points of interest listed on my profile for conversation starters. This app doesn’t care cause it’s method for match making is terrible inefficient. I’m looking to date and this app doesn’t help me with my goals.

Original: I’m pretty sure 99% of this app’s users aren’t obese, yet that’s all I’m shown.","Hinge"

8300435549,"2022-01-30 16:34:06","AdamStrickland","8.26.0","Hinge worked for me",5,"I’ll be honest, I had no faith in online dating or the prospect of meeting someone online that wasn’t shady but Hinge was great for me. I downloaded the app in December 2021 and quickly had several matches of quality people who fit what I was looking for, but one of the first people I met ended up being amazing and we quickly developed a strong relationship. They were one of the “recommended to me” persons and we hit it off immediately. 

Just a few ideas on my end for Hinge, now that I’m done with the app and it’s been deleted:

1- give a request for a deletion reason. Right now, when you delete the app, it’s just deleted, but I feel like it should be asking why you’re deleting so they can track the success of the app. Add me to the “don’t need it anymore” category. 

2- push users to take conversations offline. Right now, Hinge detects when a phone number is shared in chat and follows up asking if you met, but that’s it. I found a few conversations lingered in that “relationship Q&A” phase but Hinge should push users to migrate off the app and move. Maybe after 5-10 messages send a prompt to each user to say “enjoying the conversation? Maybe you should meet!” to take away some anxiety some users may have in moving forward. 

3- entice users to send messages with their likes. This isn’t Tinder; I had 10+ likes only with no comments. Those matches never pushed forward because the users weren’t trying to engage me, so I didn’t want to engage them. Bumble sends a “are your sure” message when you try to send just a simple “hey”, Hinge should prevent likes only. 

Great app, thanks to the developers for this as it’s been an awesome experience that I hope to never have to repeat!","Hinge"

The features are great and when a match does happen it’s great, but that has become less frequent since Roses and Standouts. I understand they need revenue, but it was much better with a simple paid subscription and no paywall for “high ranked” standout profiles. 

Hinge is great when a match happens, but unfortunately Roses has made the time between matches and conversations 10x longer than before. I still use it but I’m disappointed interactions & conversations have become to rare.","Hinge"

I’ve had this app for a long time, paid and unpaid, and it’s always had the same issues. Bottom lines:

1. Hinge knows if you’re less attractive, and treats your profile as such
2. They put attractive people behind paywalls
3. You’ll rarely see “popular” (attractive) profiles unless you pay for the app
4. I’ve never heard a guy complain about “getting too many likes” - girls constantly have that problem - while guys MIGHT get a like or two over the course of multiple weeks.

To Hinge developers: Use your big smart algorithm to weed out the profiles that are OBVIOUSLY fake or long since inactive (another problem) instead of using it to 

And do SOMETHING to encourage users to send likes, instead of just sitting there doing nothing, or sitting there accepting likes. Maybe offer some bonus feature if a profile actually sends x likes per week.","Hinge"

So I guess their new business plan is to exploit their target audience for every penny they can get their grubby little hands on. It’s honestly a shame because until now i preferred bumble to other dating apps but there really isn’t much point if i can only like five people a day, i mean if i just go to Walmart I end up seeing like 50 people so my chances of finding someone are 10 times higher if I try to pick up girl in Walmart.

Also the app really needs to include options for people to indicate that they are ethically non-monogamous or a couple looking for a third because that is half of the people I see on the app when my preferences are set to be interested in women.

Let’s ignore their new money grab scheme and just stick with the basics. 

Pros: Women message first. Lots of quick stats you can look at if people fill them out. Good and easy UI. Lots of users in many areas due to popularity.

Cons: The app doesn’t force you to completely fill out the profile which leaves you looking at a lot of empty profiles. You can no longer use two free filters. Their customer support is non existent. If you don’t use your account for awhile they seem to autodelete it but not really because you have to use a new email. The app uses a ton of data so it appears there are several networking issues. The app crashes consistently and logs you out. Even when I have good service, I have trouble sending and receiving messages. There are a ton of couples/polys on the app especially in my area and there needs to be a separate gender filter for that. And last but not least (actually it’s the reason I updated this review): I’ve been banned from the app and they won’t tell me why and there’s no way to get unbanned from what I can tell. I have reached out to customer support but I’m not hopeful.

Customer service will claim that this is to “encourage thoughtful swiping” when in reality it is designed to make you pay for a monthly subscription.  Remember: these apps don’t want you to find anyone; any users who find lasting relationships don’t keep using the app, and users who stop using the app don’t pay for subscriptions.

One suggestion I have is that when you’re first looking at the profile of someone and you scroll to the bottom you only have the option to swipe right or super swipe them but you can’t send them a message right then and there and that would be an improvement I think to have that option because the other person can still not respond if they don’t feel like you have enough in common and that’s it that’s all I have for you so far  - thanks..!","Bumble"

Most people look at a picture and take 3-5 seconds to tell if someone is worth even initiating a conversation with. Both sides have to agree that the other looks to their standards. You are making an app that you use a picture to determine if someone LOOKS good. Both sides have to agree on looks of the other. If either side says no for any reason, they can no longer talk and it’s a wasted connection. This is just the fundamental principle of this concept and is a reflection of a society and culture that only judges who they want to entertain based on LOOKS and nothing else. Any relationship that does get to happen will not be guaranteed to actually work as there’s more than someone than LOOKS. Society has made it so these and other apps are becoming the only means of social activity. No longer can you go out and physically see people and get to know them but that’s a whole other topic for other soapbox.

Now on to how the apps actually behave. You have to understand when someone swipes right on someone it doesn’t need to tell the other party that they said yes to you. The app and the backend could just ignore it and tell you that you have no results. The app can also limit who sees your profile and what profiles you get to see. The app can hide your profile even if you are using their paid priority show me first mechanic. This here adds to a system that already puts the odds in the favor of the house. If I’m spending actual real life money on this app, I should be shown first to everyone when they open the app similar to lightning lane or fastpass. For the amount of money paid for premium subscription, they shouldn’t be gatekeeping potential friends or otherwise and my profile should be shown to everyone and when me or someone swipes right, it should go through to the other person 100% of the time. A possible solution to that would be to show “people who you didn’t like who liked you” below people you didn’t already make a decision on. You can still make money and not be rigged like a slot machine. I would like more transparency in the app and would like to see more metrics like how many people liked or disliked me. Another thing you can do is add “why do you like/dislike this person” with 5 options so the other person can give constructive feedback or praise that they need to answer before going to the next person in line. The app and similar apps with similar to identical business models are toxic and are extremely harmful to a society of people with already low self confidence, anxiety and even sadly depression and social anxiety. If people are not liked on your apps, they might translate that to other social media and the real world and think they are worthless all because you want to make a buck and count beans. I know running an app and hiring people is not free but, like I said before you can still make money and let people actually connect to others. It shouldn’t be rocket science to find a friend or otherwise on your apps especially when you pay a premium to use them.","Bumble"

I kid you not I get 1 match per month on this app and their response was my pictures are blurry. 
I really only date other girls of my culture just to make my parents happy but ya out of all the apps bumble had the weakest results and it’s bad cause I bought premium…

On Hinge I get 1-2 likes per day without premium and as a guy I guess that’s a lot versus the standard 100 per minute a girl gets.

Bumble said: use “clear photos” but my accurate guess is they did something to make my account show up less or they make it so your seen a lot when you first start using the app and when you make purchases. 

Try 
Hinge 
Culture specific dating apps (if you have to please your parents)
Tinder
- Bumble is at the bottom

End experience for a daily user for a month and I’ve had it for about 6 months 
I’ve gotten 9 matches…

When two people match, there should be no further permission or confirmation needed in order to start chatting. We are adults, not children. If you do not want someone to message you, then do not swipe right on them. If you swiped right by accident and don’t want to talk to them, then simply unmatch with them. 99% of the time I match with someone, they never even send that first message, so the chat expires. Can someone explain what the point of that is? I watch match after match expire and I am not even allowed to reach out and send a message to someone who, after all, showed interest in me. Since men cannot initiate conversation I think it is abusing the service for women to swipe right on men and never send them a message. Was it just the little ego boost they were after anyway? It makes for a very frustrating experience for men as their hands are tied and they have no way of reaching out. What a childish game. Most women simply say something like ‘Hi’ as a first message anyway, which is fine, but this essentially means that they still want you to start the conversation after all. I believe most women don’t really want to message first, and if this is true then the rule is actually going against what most women want, making it even dumber. ‘Women message first’ is a stupid and pointless extra step in the process. I cannot see how simply being the first to message after you match with someone empowers the woman in any way. That’s not real empowerment, it’s pointless virtue signaling by Bumble.","Bumble"

My profile did not show to the 5 profiles with no preferences and within 20 miles of me. Bumble clearly has the worst algorithm and profile shuffling for match making out of practically any dating app I’ve tried.

I’ve been on other dating apps that allow you to simply set where you live manually. Third, it runs on just a simple swipe mechanism. No liking specific parts of a profile or anything like that.

Communication cost $$$ unless you hand out personal info to the strangers on this app.  And then after I spent $40 for a single month my luck must have turned pretty bad. After swiping right here and there for about 3 and a half weeks I matched with 1 of my 3 choices. The only one I wanted to match with turned out to be a very crazy catfish who looked the opposite of her picture to put it nicely. She lied about having kids and started acting absolutely insane by the end of our 1st date. Very long story short this was either the unluckiest or worst $40/month subscription I have ever purchased.","Bumble"

Apparently I am a match with a couple of but it only gives them 24 hours to message back and I just have to wait. I did have the opportunity to extend the time for another 24 hours. But It ran out. For some people finding a match is difficult. I feel like one of the main features is that women have the control over making the first move and also adding an additional time constraint on if unnecessary. To add insult to injury I have to watch the clock count down and really have nothing to do but watch it tick.  From my understanding I have expressed that I like her and she expressed that she like me via the app. For some reason this starts a clock. I am realistic and I know I'm not typically going to be the first choice. But by the time a lady may turn back to to the 2nd or 3rd choice. I have already disappeared. And all I can do is watch the clock.   
Another issue is the so called superswipe. I paid to buy these things and I have literally seen no difference in activity on my account.

I even used the spotlight that’s supposed to boost your profile but only got 1 new like after saying it could “boost your profile up to 16x”. It felt like a complete scam.

I’ve lost many potential matches this way or some that I’ve messaged and they don’t respond with the 24 hours.

One even just ended the chat the day of! 

It would be nice for the profile not to be limited to 3 questions to get to know the person more before swiping. There’s really not much to go off of except for looks and generic things that many people have in common. 

If the app is serious about connecting people for a potential relationship then allow the user to have the option to put as much as they want or as little as they want. And maybe real get-to-know-me questions too.. not only irrelevant, comedic ones. 

Guys on here seem too casual with bios having “don’t take life too seriously” as a common theme. I’ve gotten messages that make this app seem more like a place to hook up than actually meet a potential partner. 

Now I get that it’s not necessarily the app’s fault that guys on here don’t know proper manners when talking to women but again, it’s the lack of information in the profile that makes this app rely more on physical attraction rather than letting personality show.

One more thing, instead of waiting for the woman to make the move, I wouldn’t mind hearing from the guy first too. Especially if they swiped first. in a way, matching with them (or accepting their match so to speak) is just another way of saying, “sure I’ll chat with you”","Bumble"

I decided to upgrade and get the life membership. (To save money long term)
And to be able to connect with more people.

They advertise and suggest these features are truly unlimited when it’s not.

If you are on the free version they cap you on daily activity.

If you use the premium they see doing too much activity as spam. And can block you from the app  at any time without warning.

Due to all the technical issues I was having and people not getting my messages on the app.
I suggested people could reach out to me on Instagram or continue to speak here within the app.
(You can have your Instagram attached to your profile. Which would mean anyone could see your Instagram if they desired to.)
Which is why I ONLY shared a partnered app as an additional means of communication due to Bumbles technical issues.
I would of been more patient, however connections do expire if you do not message them promptly.

In all if I did it all over I would of stuck with the free version and only reach out to 5-10 people daily. And would of asked the other person their desired means of communication and not directly giving my own.

I want a relationship that can lead to marriage, and that isn’t happening if we’re unevenly yoked — so why even go there? Please move this filter to the free part of the app. It’s the ONLY paid feature I care about, and I’m not paying for something so simple that should be free.

Other than that big issue, the rest seems fine as far as I’ve seen. The biggest issue isn’t something they can fix, it’s an issue with my area and the demographic here.

Bumble does not actually care about women, they only used that concept to trick us into believing that they built something with our dagger in mind, when the reality is, they built something to make money off of women’s trust, while simultaneously ignoring those who have become victims while using their app. So many women report men on this app and nothing is done by bumble.

Continuously adding useless content, constantly logs you out and ask you to reconnect with Facebook then just says ""account already given permission"" doesn't load things, filled with insane amounts of spam accounts, and ask you leave a review literally every time you use it even if you already have. Don't download this, and definitely do not support the developers.

8555669828,"2022-04-11 11:56:23","Louis R. Tursi","13.4.0","There’s no harm in giving it a try.",4,"To the general public, here is what I have to say. The experience one may have on an app like Tinder is subjective. It’s different for everybody and can highly depend on where you are located, your profile, your intent, etc. Males beware: do not be surprised when the majority of women you ask to hook up with you decline. Females beware: do not be surprised when the majority of men—or rather, boys—ask you if you’re down to hook up. Whatever gender you are, whichever gender you are seeking, and whatever your intention with an app like this is, do not set your expectations high. Download it, swipe based on your interests, close the app, and go about the rest of your day and just see what happens. If it goes well, great! If it doesn’t, so what? Tinder is not the end-all-be-all, and that is my best advice.

Regarding the app itself though, as someone who has been using it on and off for a little over three years as of writing this, I’m surprised that it’s still as incredibly buggy as it is given that it was released over a decade ago. For example, the notification badges on it get stuck on a random high number for no reason, despite me having opened all of my matches and reading all my messages. As of late, the information within the app does not even update. In other words, I’ll receive a new notification that I’ve gotten a new match or that someone has sent me a new message, and upon opening the app, nothing has changed. I have tried signing out and signing back in, deleting the app completely (followed by waiting a while) and reinstalling it, and I’ve even contacted support regarding all these issues and they were just about as helpful as my dog’s sh*t.

To conclude, I personally love what this app has brought and contributed to my life. I don’t know what my life would be like today without it, but I can guarantee it would not be the way it is now; far from it, in fact. I’ve been using it for nearly three years and have had a blast with it since I first signed up for it. With all that being said, just try it already. It really couldn’t hurt; I honestly don’t know what you’re still waiting for. (Plus, you’ve read this entire review for a reason, did you not?)

To the developers, all I have to say to you is... fix the functionality issues already. You update this app like once every two weeks claiming you’ve ""fixed bugs"" (without any further explanation). Stop lying to make yourself look good, please and thank you.","Tinder"

The main issue with the app is that there are too many annoying and repetitive bugs that completely destroy the user experience. 

First off, why even have an option to “only show people in this range” if every other profile you show is 2000+ miles away from the range I set? I mean, I get it. The app runs out of users to show you after a while and is forced to recommend profiles outside the range. But then why not just say that the app has run out of profiles and leave it at that? My guess is that the devs are trying way too hard to waste people’s time and keep them on the app as long as possible.

Second, literally every other swipe I get a notification that says “Super like to increase your odds by 5x.” Now, I personally wouldn’t care about the constant notification. But it’s literally right above the profiles distance for you. Which is the number. one. consideration. when deciding on whether to swipe right or not. Again, this goes back to my initial theory that the devs are looking for ways to keep users on the app. 

I can’t tell you how many times I’ve logging out and back in, deleted the app and it’s data. Nothing fixes these issues, because they’re not bugs, they’re features.","Tinder"

Free users didn’t used to have limited likes, nor did it feel like they HAD to pay to have their profile seen. Now it seems like you have to pay to even be noticed. 

Paid users used to only have to pay $9.99/mo get a weekly boost, unlimited likes, a handful of super likes, and some good service.  Now, it’s one boost a month with a subscription, $8 per boost, 1 super like per month, and I can only imagine they’ll continue taking more away.

There’s no way to tell political leanings unless they put certain tags in their profile or put it in their bio. There’s no way to know important things like if they have pets or drink/smoke unless they happened to answer those questions-they’re optional. There’s no way to make it so you only see people that don’t have pets or don’t smoke or restrict out certain tags a person might add as their interest, for example “Activist”. To be a better app, these things need the focus, not the cutesy “Vibes” questions that don’t have much meaning to whether they’re going to be a good partner or not.

As an American my rights are inalienable. A online dating app shouldn’t have control over that in this regard nor should be able to filter what I say on my dating profile just because it offended someone. That’s not my problem if it offended someone. Tinder is no different than these other garbage online platforms like Twitter or Facebook with the censorship of our free speech and accounts as a whole. In online dating its import to have a bit oh honestly inside your profile. I believe this will help polarize people a little better towards me and ultimately get better matches that are in more alignment with what I believe in. Tinder banned my account for expressing my free speech. This is un-American and unconstitutional. This app has gone downhill exponentially since it’s inception.  I wouldn’t recommend this app due to the water downed quality of it, free speech censorship and the inferior design. Also, this app has a huge stigma of being the so called hookup app so nobody takes it seriously anymore. Definitely recommend Bumble over this app due to it having better features. Won’t ever use Tinder again.","Tinder"

That experience cost me $25. Don’t waste your money on an app with such bad development resources that they can’t ensure the core functionality even remotely works. Don’t spend your money on a product that their own resources don’t care to maintain. If the people getting compensated to support this application won’t even do their jobs, I don’t understand how this app thinks they can charge you $25 for basic capabilities.

Tinder used to be functional and good, now it’s a busted waste of money.

I’ve had match after match, come to find out, all bots and scammers that try to get you to add them on Snapchat, and then they unlatch. For $25, you’d expect the company to crack down on phishers and scammers, for the service charge, I guess not.

I’ve cancelled my subscription following, and probably will give up even the free version in a month when this is done, they won’t prorate and I might as well use up the remainder of what I’ve paid for.

My account was banned. I have the most vanilla account on the planet and was certain it was an error. Tinder responded and admitted it was their error and that my account was banned (forever) because it was accidentally flagged as a spam account.

Then they proceed to tell me to sign up again, but that’s impossible because you have to use your phone number to sign up (you can’t use a burn number) and my phone number is forever banned. 

So thanks Tinder for having the worst algorithm on the planet that bans real accounts FOREVER with no way for those people to ever get back on the app.

You have an obligation to have a more sensitive and compassionate process around this. You know many of the people on your app are already feeling rejected, lonely, and depressed, and you make it worse by banning them from a way to connect with others and accusing them of doing something they didn’t do. It’s so wrong on so many levels. 

I mean does anyone on your team actually read these reviews?! You would think you would change the process of banning accounts by now given the thousands of complaints that say they all experienced the exact same thing.","Tinder"

To clarify, my profile had not violated any of the community guidelines, nor had any messages since I was unable to send one the entire time having the app. When I asked customer service again for removal of the unearned ban, all I could receive was a “we can not provide more details at this time. Your account is permanently banned due to violating community guidelines.”

Every aspect of this app has led to a horrible experience. I highly do not recommend this app. Spend your money elsewhere. Hopefully they treat you better.","Tinder"

the odds are stacked against men in terms of numbers, supply n demand boys. plus, if you swipe right on too many women (who don’t respond), you get shuttled to the bottom and no one will ever see you. Men can also get shadow banned - and won’t even know it  - profile hidden and no responses.

Sometimes my profile will be shown at random times and I'll get 10 like within half an hour, but this doesn't happen too often and I'll only get a couple a day. The culture has also changed around it for the worse, many years ago it was super easy to have a bunch of matches that led to conversations that led to dates. Now almost none of the matches reply to my messages, and the ones that end up planning a date often cancel or don't show up to the date.

It’s not tinders fault although the membership is expensive and restrictive towards the guy looking to be in relationship vs the guy that’s looking to explore multiple options. It boils down too American culture. Tinder is in the middle you can’t monitor how a person will be in person or how they will react later on .  3 stars is a good gauge if the app was less restrictive towards people who haven’t paid for the membership I would give them more stars .The average person won’t want to pay for the membership but again nothing is free .

Trying to tell me that these profiles which never change Are people who are constantly deleting and re-creating their profiles. However a couple of these profiles are people I know so I’ve asked them and they said they do not do that. Beyond the horrible customer service and clearly buggy app, There’s no way to limit the distancing with your profile will show up. For example I don’t want people in a different country much less those 100+ miles away to see my profile.  I only want to show up locally. So when I broke down and paid to see the hundred plus people who had swiped right, most of them were 3000 miles away.  I decided it’s time to delete this stupid app. It doesn’t work right, the features to have your profile only show up where you want it to do not exist, and the customer service is horrible.

Its user interface encouraged a dialogue both in the forms of prompts and easy-to-engage photography seen on profiles.

For every 10 potential matches for men, maybe 4 or 5 would be of interest.

So what happened?

Like most apps nowadays, Hinge got to work on “improving” its algorithm(s). The aim, obvious as it may seem, was to produce BETTER user experiences by matching users with seemingly similar traits, interests, and (purely subjective) “levels of attractiveness”.

And now, for every 10 potential matches for men - *maybe* 1 is of interest (the experience reported by multiple male users).

What it did not take into consideration is the demographic breakdown of its users: roughly 65% are men while the remaining 35% are female (according to Hinge itself).

This disparity is also heightened by basic gender preferences, primarily the 80/20 principle, in that 20% of the men receive 80% of the attention of women (think of high school and how all of the girls wanted to date the boys on the football team).

In summary, the apps algorithm(s) have made matching a one-way street in which the women get plenty of potential matches with people of similar or higher attractiveness, whereas men do not.

So if you’re a female searching for a male - you’ll have no problem.

If you’re a male searching for a female - you’d have better odds of meeting a woman at an all-male prep academy.","Hinge"

I highly doubt they ‘carefully’ reevaluated my profile within those 7 minutes while responding with a paragraph response. I have other apps, used this one before a handful of times and never once had an issue. It’s rather disrespectful when you spend some money to support the app and they completely disregard your appeal without even telling you the reason why it was banned. I’ve seen many women who have had profanity and other things on their profiles and have no punishment done but given how I’m one of many guys who use the app I’m easily disposable.
Besides the unfairness of the developers a complaint I have is the distance settings. I have it set to where if there are no people left within the distance then no profiles should show up.

Two of my main complaints; first, they put all their most attractive members in the “Standouts” section. You can only contact Standouts by sending them a rose. (Yeah…it feels like The Bachelor) You get 1 rose/week for free, and beyond that, you have to pay for more. They’re not cheap. 
Second: BOTS! I’ve seen a significant increase in the number of bots since I started using. And they’re usually in the Standouts. This morning I noticed at least 3-4 in the mix. They’re always extremely conventionally attractive, from another country, their personal info has something nonsensical in it, the prompts mention marriage or long term relationships, and pics feature them w/animals. If you connect w/ them, they immediately respond and after a few messages, ask for your phone number or try to get you on What’sapp. I always report them, but I can’t even imagine how many users are unwittingly spending money on roses for bots.

The more information on your profile or another persons profile increases the chances of you liking something other than just their looks I found that this has led to much more engaging and relatable matches with others not only that but leading those comments on their profile has led to easier conversations as it is a total ice breaker The conversation starts with the comment that you made after you match and you can build off of what you sent I found this has led to more genuine conversations and has been a overall amazing experience Ive had tinder and bumble for several years now and I found the whole experience to be very difficult with few matches and disinterested people even when I use the paid subscriptions little changed After a few days of downloading this app I saw a completely different results for the reasons I mentioned above Theres so many features that allow a person to be able to follow up on people who like them without the use of a paid subscription Ive been able to match with several people and I am very interested to meet one of them Overall Ive been absolutely thankful for discovering this app Thank you Hinge and best of luck to the rest of youI dont know how they do it but it works I have never in my however many years of online/app dating, regardless of the site or platform, been able to meet someone I was compatible with. It’s difficult sorting through, what is essentially lists and lists of people (who sometimes distract you with their pretty faces and not much else), hoping that you find someone who is compatible with you. These new changes that aim to get you off the app, whatever they are, they work. After being on here for a couple/few months, Hinge more and more started to send me men I found attractive and was more likely to have good conversation with. I met a guy that I really like, and we’ve been seeing each other for less than a couple months but I have never met a man who I could talk to for hours on end like this.

I’m guessing it’s in a drive to push you towards the paid version, but originally the app would show a mix of people, some I’d be interested in and some I wouldn’t. Now days all the app shows are people I’d rank 3/10 or less.

Sorry honey, I don’t find a 5’5” girl weighing 230lbs attractive and I don’t think many do…… I would prefer these aren’t the only girls that show up on my regular feed.  It’s as though by showing you all the undesirables, they think people are going to pay to unlock the less ugly people….. really? If you are playing these tricks before I pay, what tricks do you play after I’ve paid and I can’t get a refund. It seems as though they also stop most matches going through as I used to get a response to a good proportion of likes, but now I never get a reply. The same goes for receiving likes. I originally used to receive a few likes a week yet over the last many months don’t receive any. I find it hard to believe my unchanged profile would have suddenly dropped all its appeal.

Either the developers have accidentally ruined this app, or more likely, the executives intentionally ruined it by trying to force you into the paid version- “what’s our next plan in the quest for MONEY? I know, let’s stop showing people that would actually match with each other and then bombard them with the option to upgrade so they have to give us $ in order to actually get use out of this app”.

One thing I do find interesting is that new users haven’t had time to be profiled by the hinge algorithm yet so hinge still shows them to everybody until it realizes they are attractive and stashes them away where they won’t show except for the expensive standouts section. 

Don’t download this app, or if you do, make the most of the first couple of weeks you have it. After that you may as well delete it because all you’re gonna find are uglies & fatsos or at least the opposite of the type of people you were originally trying to match with. (If fatsos are your thing it’ll probably end up showing you all the hot girls instead)","Hinge"

It seems as though hinge have implemented a new algorithm that pushes the least “swiped right” users to the very front. This will sound vain, but in the past I used to get a mix of attractive and unattractive girls showing. The last month or so it has been purely unattractive girls, as in, the most unattractive that you without a doubt swipe left on immediately.  

I’m not gonna sugar coat it: 
This would make sense to improve statistics, as if all the regular/ hot girls are always getting matches and the uggos are not, the app won’t meet whatever goals the corporation have set for number of matches, therefore they push the uggos so they have the best chance of finding a match, and barely show the hotties seeing as they are likely to get many matches from just minimal exposure. 

I myself used to get many matches, albeit from uggos who probably match with any 5 or above. However in the last month or so I haven’t even been  getting these. It straight dropped off. This algorithm would also fit this situation as I was getting too many matches so I have been dropped to the “show least” or at-least “show less” pool. 

Don’t bother signing up for this app unless you have a “thing” for what the majority of society deem “unattractive”. The developers may have some politically/ socially responsible response and claim something else, but we all know the PR machine is strong with large corporations so take their reply with a grain (or many) of salt.

I literally explicitly state on my profile that I don’t want to talk to moderates and apoliticals… and yet you throw up a wall of money (roses for “standouts”) between me and moderates and folks who don’t list their politics (which is actually just kind of funny because, nah, I’m not paying for that).

Hinge can easily block the IP address or find another way but they refuse to do it. Instead after me reporting over 100 fake profile accounts that keep popping up with the same bio, instead of protecting us they came out with a new terms and conditions that is so long and it only protects them, not us.

When a girl likes me, I match with her and put the ball in her court only to get a “Hi”. I know the ration of girls to guys on these apps heavily favors guys but how about a little effort? When I do eventually get a date going the girl 9/10 expects me to pay for everything.

I met a girl on here who is the love of my life, and we are going so strong I am lucky I met her. The app is genuine and doesn’t “throttle down” your views or have too much spam B.S. Yes your swipes are limited for the day but it’s a somewhat small price to pay for actual genuine interaction every time you match. The interface is also great and you can comment with your likes for a little extra intrigue.

The first time, finding matches was relatively easy and consistent and I met some really great people. I entered a relationship with one of them for a couple years and deleted the app.

A few months ago I redownloaded Bumble and Hinge. My experience with Bumble this time around has been pretty abysmal. The very first day there was an influx of likes, and in the weeks since I've received around 5 total. Compare this with Hinge, where likes are more direct than a simple right swipe, yet I receive them on a daily basis. I use the same photos on both apps; the only difference is the apps themselves.

That influx of likes you get your first day on Bumble seems very manipulative considering your profile will likely not receive that kind of attention ever again. They try to get you hooked with an initial burst of likes, and then they start pushing their absurdly priced premium features. It's embarrassingly transparent.

They refused to explain why they were taking the photo down when I messaged them and I looked up the guidelines and my photo was perfectly fine. Bumble must have some Puritan standards because that extremism is the only way the photo could be considered inappropriate. I guess my halloween costume as a vampire bunny from the ribcage up was just too raunchy for their Puritan standards. Must gave been the exposed shoulders and uncovered collar bones.

I think it’s designed to make you frustrated so that you’ll pay their crazy overpriced subscription fees. Personally I’ve gotten less of this vibe on hinge. But both apps will match you with people where you are incompatible in some way and sometimes you’ve already established a connection by the time you notice. Maybe you realize you missed that they smoke cigarettes or don’t want kids or already have kids and it’s really frustrating. Oh unless you pay a buttload of money. I wish you could pay just a few dollars to use an advanced filter or whatever. 
- unlike Hinge you have to pay to see who likes you. $20 per WEEK is the cheapest. 
- if you’re a lesbian the app will completely disrespect that and show you profiles of men. Obviously there are a ton of couples looking for unicorns and they don’t don’t do anything to try to help this. But none of the other apps do either I guess.","Bumble"

Two major problems I see are 

1) the use of meaningless hieroglyphic icons that seem to randomly switch around on every page makes navigation very tedious and difficult; WHEN will developers learn to use text menus that we can just look at to see what they’re for, instead of having to experiment by clicking on every one to see if they do something useful or are what we’re looking for?  A single drop down text menu in the upper left corner where menus belong would be a massive improvement in usability, instead of scattering meaningless hieroglyphs randomly around the screen. 

2) poor contrast of light yellow-orangey text on white backgrounds in Setup areas makes certain operations slow and difficult. Not as bad as the use of meaningless icons, but still unnecessary. Suspect the developer isn’t using naive testers on a variety of devices like he should, but instead is probably developing on a Mac with a high contrast screen where his light-on-light text is discernible and where the use of meaningless hieroglyphics for navigation has long been standard practice—and the reason that I and many others loathe Apple products.","Bumble"

It’s really easy to make a mistake from the beeline view where profiles are shown two per row, because you try to swipe the person on the left and it selects the person on the right.

But what really gets me here, is the way they handle gender identity and how they categorize it. I’m a trans male, who’s interested in women, and I’ve had no problems in my past with dating women. But if I change my gender identity to “trans man” on this app and set my preference as “women” my feed is changed to nothing but other women who are interested in women, or people looking for “poly” relationships. I don’t think I’m quite what lesbians are looking for bumble? But once I set my gender back to “male” I’m brought back to women who are interested in men. So I have no choice but to just put “male” and then that I’m “trans” in my bio. So maybe something needs to be changed about that? Why should I feel that I’m less of a man on this app? I get that you try and pair “lgbtq+” with others in that same category, but make it make sense. If I say I’m “straight” I should only be seeing what my preference is. If others choose to not like me because I’m trans, let them make that decision.","Bumble"

You used to get a large number of swipes per day which is now limited to about 25. This smaller number of swipes is sold under the illusion of “thoughtful swiping,” but if the company actually cared about “thoughtful swiping” then they wouldn’t offer unlimited swiping like they do in their paid version in the first place. They also took away the free back track feature that lets you bring back profiles you accidentally swiped left on, and took away the ability to bring back one expired match every 24 hours.

Now I’d rank Bumble below Hinge and Tinder in terms of overall experience.

This is especially crucial when for example you move or enter a period of new growth. And BFF inherently recognizes that people sometimes are solely looking for friends where sex can never be an option and harassment is a nonstarter, hence it limits matches only to the same gender. That only works for heterosexual people, and there is no way to change that setting. Cis-identifying queer people have no way of seeking platonic friendships safe from the risk of harassment or sexual pressure. And the utilization of the binary completely removes choice and sense of belonging for trans and non-binary folx for whom harassment and sexual pressure are never off the table anyways.

In short, why is the platonic side of this app geared first and foremost with cis-hets in mind, with virtually no liberty for queer people? Do we not deserve friends of our own choosing? Are we inherently incapable of making lasting and deep friendships with others of different gender identities?? Bumble BFF answers the latter two questions with a resounding YES. Shameful.","Bumble"

Even though I pay $20 a month (which is ridiculous btw) you have to pay an extra $5 to even be shown on other peoples profiles, and even so your only shown for 30 minutes. I’ve done it once and maybe got 2 likes so it’s very clear that is the only way for your account to be shown to other people. If you actually want to match and talk to real people on this app be ready to spend $50-$100 a month.

On top of all this it never shows you anyone with similar interests, maybe 1 out of 20 people shown will have similar interests and wants as you.

You have to allow us to shoot our shot the best way we know how and use the other features God gave us to get women (other than looks)and not let a app control the process of who gets to talk to you. In real life u get approached everyday by men if you are attractive and that will be the same on a dating app so why is that a bad thing? What a guy says to you verbally in person can change your mind about him even if he is 5’8 and not as attractive as u would like. This app doesn’t let a man use his mind to stimulate you because he can’t speak to you unless you think he is hot and you hit the “like” button and even then he still can’t reach out to you. He has to wait and watch the clock tick away and lose his chance or pay for a extension. This app is designed so women can match with 100 men in 20 mins but won’t get 100 messages in their inbox. This app is actually the worst of them all because the owner got all her ideas from Tinder when she worked there but got fired and filed sexual harassment charges against the owners. She is a woman that is now scorned and created this app to put men down! Men are like little boys waiting for permission to speak on this app. Let men be men and the men that uses this app will be those momma boys or insecure men who WANTS and NEEDS a woman to approach him first because he is not secure within himself to approach you first!

The whole experience just feels icky to me because I’m looking for someone to date monogamously, and I don’t like thinking that these straight men are just reviewing my profile wondering if I’ll be the one to help him fulfill his gross fantasy of a threesome with a lesbian who **maybe he can turn!**","Bumble"

I checked the back track price and at $8 a week that was way too much so I swiped another profile. I reconsidered it so I went to buy backtrack just to find out that you can only backtrack the most recent profile. If people are paying ridiculous prices the least you can do is make it be available to select other accounts to backtrack or at least provide a disclosure when purchasing so people know it only works for the most recent profile. Then I realized the $8 a week was for very limited things and then saw it was $33 a month to see who saw your profile!

The whole point of paying is to make all this online dating stuff easier. Will probably cancel the subscription soon but will try to wait to see if they fix things.
